## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Arnold Palmer grew up in St. Augustine in Lizzon, Jacksonville. And no, he's not the golfer. He just has the same name, and he does get asked about that. Yes, I'll have to do my parents' game in Ina. That's one in 64. St. John's County. Arnold graduated from St. Augustine High School, where he was a good student and an athlete. Then his life took a different turn. I decided to sell drugs, and I was doing a lot of things that I shouldn't have been doing. Finally, my got caught. I went to Perusum, the at 17 years and 17, straight days. While in Perusum, I decided to educate myself, I decided to take a course by my courses, and I end up getting my socialism, I've asked my masters, and my doctor's degree, and biblical studies. That was this change in my life. And after those 17 years, Arnold Palmer was sent out of prison and back on the street with little more than his freedom. I realized that it was going to be kind of hard. Doing the time that I was in Perusum, needed my halve, computers, and so once I got out, I moved to Jackson here. I started hitting a pavement and it looked for a job. And I didn't realize that when you're going to place the first thing, me say it's going online, and I did not have no skills in that area. It was kind of fresh, straightened. Arnold found ready for work, a nonprofit program that helps people released from prison to prepare for jobs. Arnold thought he needed more time to work on some of his issues. My emotional feelings, things that passed, things that I was still holding home to, they had a milk-to-health service here that can help you with that. Also work, don't relationship, so it might go on to it because I didn't see them for 17-year-olds. I was hit up with that. I finally got a job at Maro's smokehouse on Beachville of Arn. I'm a prep cook. What ever they made me do, I do it. I just feel very, very good today. Arnold Palmer hopes to move on with his professional life. Starting in prison, and now with ready for work, he's become a speaker. Never been trying to speak. We're really my hardest towards helping other people because maybe I'm a drug killer for so many years. I feel like that I can be an inspiration. I started facilitating classes on substance of Bruce and NAA, and I speak up here at least one at San Bernard II West. His biggest task he says is building a relationship with daughters who grew up without him around. One daughter, she's very happy at my life is right. She's a teacher in San Bernard's county. She's 28. I have another daughter she stays in West Palm Beach. She's also a teacher. I have a very good relationship with him. Put me not to be there if I'd known for 17 years and get not, and their mothers had a heart to not disobey me to save our things of our people. Through the healing process, for both Arnold and his family, he's learned a few things. I'm not trying to make it the easy way, working hard for what you know and doing it in legal way. The healing process for me is when I took Arnold's shield. I took Arnold's shield of it, and I just released it. In addition to his family, Arnold Palmer of Jacksonville feels he owes something to his name. My name is a special name, Arnold Palmer, because I ever go everybody's like Arnold Palmer. So I'm going to live up to that name because he's a very popular person and he's a lot to help people. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
