## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Mary Grace Doran is a graphic designer, a counselor and a spiritual coach. She speaks about healing with the authority of her personal story. Since this interview first aired 16 months ago, Mary Grace has begun the process of becoming certified as a lay chaplain. I think that over my own personal journey, I've had a lot of healing. It just kind of evolved that I wanted to be involved in spiritual direction. Mary Grace contracted HIV from a rape 20 years ago. There are many things that make Mary Grace remarkable, but none more so than simply her own example. As a person living with HIV, for 20 years, my doctor early on saw that I was living well with the disease and incorporating a holistic approach to my wellness and started referring patients to me to encourage them to have the same type of lifestyle. Mary Grace's lifestyle is in a nutshell to leave each day to its fullest. My naturally became a spiritual director. I just didn't call it that. She kept her day job as a graphic designer and communications professional, but began to work on a part-time basis for several reasons. I started allowing myself to work part-time so that I had time to do the ministry and do the training for spiritual direction and also to keep my health well. I knew that I needed to keep my stress level down to do that. I needed to work less hours, which meant the whole lifestyle change. Over time, I just began to put more emphasis on the spiritual direction. Although Mary Grace calls which she does counseling at sometimes and ministry in others, it's not denominational. She'll counsel someone regardless of his or her religion or lack of wherever they are spiritually. When you're living with a chronic illness, if I didn't have a spiritual life of some sort, then I wouldn't be able to get through with what I got through. Her personal spirituality is a blend of things that she's drawn from many sources. I combined Taoism and Tai Chi as part of my wellness. When I was going through a period of time, I was studying yoga. Of course, that's Buddhist philosophies. And so I incorporated all of those beliefs into my Christianity overall that increased my wellness. You don't have to know Mary Grace's history to know that whatever she's doing is working. I'm doing something right. And my doctors have said that. I'm part of a clinical trial from Duke University. One of the doctors there interviewed me in the case study of someone who was living well with the disease because of the lifestyle changes that I've made. Lifestyle is an overused and imprecise word and it's used today to justify almost anything as a choice. But in Mary Grace's life has in the lives of people with chronic diseases, lifestyle means choosing the elements of how to live so that one can continue to live. And if Mary Grace's spiritual counseling can be summarized in one word, it is, in fact, choice. You have a choice. You can choose to live or you can choose to die. And whatever choice you make will impact the rest of your life. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
