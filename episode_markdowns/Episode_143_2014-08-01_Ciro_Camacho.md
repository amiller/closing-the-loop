Born in La Paz, Bolivia, and educated in Kentucky, Ciro Camacho built a computer business with his wife, Rita.
He was an early practitioner at building IBM-compatible “clones” and at setting up the Novell networks to link them. Ciro was the sales and technical expert, while Rita handled the office and books.
Ciro and Rita were on the verge of selling their business and retiring when Rita was diagnosed with brain cancer. She lived for two years past her expected time, and the Camacho’s daughters moved back to Jacksonville.
When she passed away, Ciro sold the business, and re-evaluated his priorities. “We put too much importance on material things,” he says. “When we leave, we take nothing. What’s important is our relationships, the people we love.”
But he hasn’t re-evaluated his life. “If I had it to do over again, I would do it exactly the same way.”
