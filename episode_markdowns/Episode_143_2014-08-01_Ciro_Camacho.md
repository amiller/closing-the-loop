## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Ciro Camacho is a serial entrepreneur. He was a pioneer in building computers and an early expert in networking. Born in Bolivia and educated in Kentucky, he started and sold a business in Jacksonville. And from what pass I was born in La Paz came here right after I graduated from high school because of political unrest on there. They closed universities for about three years, so I came to the stage to get a profession. I'm actually have a degree in engineering, electronic engineering, and the computer business started as an accident. Ciro came to Jacksonville to work for the federal reserve and began to build IBM compatible computers. At that time the clones were running and I made the first clone for the IBM computers and at Borough about $200 out of my master car and I built the first computer and then to resist history. Ciro started his company with his wife Rita, whom he met when he first came to Kentucky for college. We were both teenagers and we used to live in these apartments, so that's how I met Rita and we got married. Yes, he was my eye-hand on the business for you know, since I graduated the company. She did all that counting and all that office management and unfortunately she passed away in less years. Ciro Camacho's wife was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. At the time, Ciro and Rita were planning the retirement in the sale of their company. We were waiting for our youngest one to graduate from college. We already had the business listed for sale. But then in October they found the tumor in Rita's brain and it happened to be a cancer. At that time they gave her 19 months to live and she lived for three years so a huge bottle. The plan before Rita's illness was to sell the company and then figure out what to do next. I think we were planning to travel all over there maybe start something on something different. Technology business is a high stress business and it's a constant changing. You know you had to keep up with it and I think after 20 something years it was a little bit too much. They also were going to decide where to live. Maybe move back to Kentucky with her family or maybe move back to Bolivia but you know it was that was a plan but life played as a different role. My life has changed so much. I can tell you. I can tell you. I just had to play one day at a time. Through his loss Ciro has gained new insight and new priorities. I think it helped me to see life from a different perspective. Things that were important one time are not important anymore. All those material things and other things you don't take anything and that makes you buy you things. You make you buy your life friendships. You know people that you know that's more important than anything else. Ciro's daughters moved to Jacksonville during their mother's illness and planned to stay here and so and all likelihood will Ciro. With the new business and his daughters and grandchildren around. Eventually I will start something else because I cannot be without doing anything but right now I just I need to think before I take my next move. You just have to keep on going. Life is wonderful and if I could do it all over again I would do it again just like the way I did it. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
