John Snyder was born in New York City to baseball-loving family, John Snyder was better at being a parish priest than he was at playing baseball.
But as he rose through the Church, eventually becoming the bishop of St. Augustine, Florida, he never lost his love of the game. Nearing 90 and retired as bishop, he meets with parishioners, as well as prisoners on Florida’s death row, and he still watches baseball on television.
