## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Ryan Westover is in his late 20s, but he dresses like he's 18. Baggy shorts, T-shirt and a baseball cap backwards. It's perfect for the cell phone and tablet repair shop in northern St. John's County that he owns. Ryan's already learned a lot about marketing. People who bring broken phones into his store often leave minutes later, their phones back in use for free. I feel that if a customer comes in, finds out that I just pull a piece of fuzz out of his charter port. And I say 20, 30 bucks. They're going to feel like they got shafted. So if you can say everything's good, just come back and see us or put us a good Google review or something of that nature, they're basically giving a free service to you as much as you just gave a free service to them. If it doesn't cost me anything, but 10 seconds or 30 seconds, even if it's two minutes, that's just my time. I know he'll be back. Ryan's family are longtime St. Augustine residents. My grandmother, she's been here all her life. My uncle Phil Jennervar, his mother owned three quarters of downtown St. Augustine. We've probably been here five, six generations. After graduating from niece high school, and then college, Ryan worked at Flagler Hospital and briefly with the St. John's County Sheriff's Department. Being a police officer or a fireman that's every voice dream, it's like, oh, I'm going to be a firefighter. Oh, I'm going to be a deputy. It's always intrigued me. It often takes working at a structure job for someone to realize that he or she is at heart and entrepreneur. It didn't matter how hard you worked or how little you worked. You're getting paid the same. So you had people that were not doing their job, and you could be busing your tail and you're making the same amount of money. To be a business owner for me, this guy's a limit. What you put in is what you're going to get out. And at the end of the day, yeah, you might not ever be rich. Ryan's opportunity came when his younger brother, Brett, got into phone repair. Brett dropped his phone in the toilet. He went to AT&T and said, how much is it for me to replace my phone? They said $450. He's like, oh, no, no, no, no. He pulled that whole thing apart and fixed it himself. He's 19. I guess that's when it struck. There might be something out there for this. Brett Westover has been running the first I-tech store in St. Augustine for three years. Ryan's store is new this year. But their name may have been a little too catchy. We got a season to cis letter. They are a multi-million dollar Forbes company. They got it registered trademarked and in the letter that we received, it said that that's what they call their technicians are I-tex. We had contacted legal authorities and the attorney told us, if you are not planning on franchising out any time soon, keep your name, maintain it until you get contacted legally from this company. We'll have to let a lot of people know. Fortunately, Ryan and Brett Westover understand that there's a window for what they do and they have an exit strategy. Technology is technology. It changes so fast. It's like I was telling my brother, you're going to business for two reasons. To build a longevity business, where are you going to business and you build a business up and then turn on and sell it? This is what that business is. It's just like the TV repair business. Years ago, you would have TV repair shops everywhere. You don't see anymore. And it's because it's cheaper to go buy one than it is to repair it. And that's where ultimately, I think the phone, the tablets, all that stuff is gonna go, but hopefully not for another, prightenier shit. I'd like to make me a comfortable living in it. I'm not even planning on being rich, but if I can provide for my family, make a good living and be happy with what I'm doing and give back to my community that's given to me, then let's all care about it. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
