## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Suzanne Ebert is a dentist who moved upon a V. Drabeach to start her career and her family in northeast Florida. I started the practice from scratch. After I finished dental school, I did a when your residency. I really had a very nice practice. I really enjoyed it. I loved having the time to spend with my girls as they were growing up. I was just kind of enjoying my life there. And that's how her life progressed for years until her daughter's graduated from high school. I started feeling like I needed to make a change in my life. I went on some mission trips. I'd been volunteering down here at the Salzburg Center for years. I'd always really wanted to teach so that was something that's always been in the back of my mind. It was just one of those. I think I'd like to do something but I don't really know what. But it was a question from one of Suzanne Ebert's own patients that set her mind in motion. There was one patient who during this time that I was mulling all of this over. He and his wife were having some pretty extensive work done. He said, well, what happens when somebody who cannot afford this kind of care? What happens to them? And that really resonated with me. I thought, you know what? It's a time when I can make a change in my life. I don't really know which way I'm going to go. I got in touch with a practice broker and six weeks later, the papers were signed and my practice was sold. It was kind of a, oh, now what? She thought she'd end up teaching at a university. In the meantime, she increased her volunteer time at the Salzburg Center. Downtown Jacksonville's shelter for the homeless provides not only food and a place to sleep, but a range of services that includes dental care. That's when she learned that the center needed a dental director. Maybe for a year, you know, something to fill the gap. Let's just see what happens. Six months into the job doctor Ebert is also teaching, bringing University of Florida dental school students to her clinic. They come here on two-week rotations. That has really been exciting for me. Suzanne Ebert sees the delivery system in action. One of my current passions is trying to decrease the emergency room usage. So a ridiculous number of patients that go to the emergency room for dental treatment. The emergency room can't provide dental treatment. They can give antibiotics. They can give pain medication. Unfortunately, then many of those people have absolutely no resources to go to a dentist to actually have their infection treated. So what happens is that they have absolutely nowhere to go. The antibiotics do their work and then the person ends up with another infection. It recurs and each time it comes back, it comes back worse and worse and sometimes it'll kill them. Dentistry is at its core, a one-on-one medical art. We do crowns. We do bridges. We do parcels. We do everything. And when you get through to somebody who's never valued it and they value it, that's huge. And that's prompted her to become more involved in the policy side of healthcare. I would like to be one of the people who actually helps to address these issues at the legislative level. There is a need to increase the access to care and it's a very practical need. Dr. Suzanne Ebert was always enthusiastic about her profession. Now she's committed. I've always loved what I do. I've always loved dentistry. I loved it when I was working in my office. I find that now I have a passion. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller. Closing the loop is going to be at one spark. Come see us in the river city gourmet shop in the Jacksonville landing.
