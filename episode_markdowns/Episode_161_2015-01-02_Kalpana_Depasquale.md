## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Calplanadee Pesqualee was born in Bangalore, India, and came to the United States with her parents when she was a little girl. My family wound up in New York and then we lived in New Jersey for about a year and then down to Florida. Calplanadee went to school and Florida through medical school and started her ear nose and throat specialty practice in St. Augustine. 11 years into her career, she's very comfortable with her choices. I think the most fun part about E&T is the fact that we can deal with all different age groups which many specialties maybe one certain age group or another. I love the fact that I can see children from two years old who adults and elderly to one hundred and two years old. She's also branched out. I used to get asked from a lot of patients where they were due Botox so they were due this or that and I was trained in all those things so I just started to do those procedures for people and one thing led to another that aspect of my practice got busier so we created a medical spa which is called a Vonti Medical Spa. Calplanadee developed a line of skincare products also called a Vonti. The growth of her career is based not only on patient needs but on her own needs to broaden her business so that it's not solely dependent on how many hours she works. About a year into my practice, one day I felt a lump in my neck. It was on my thyroid gland I knew exactly what it was. At that point I couldn't feel any other nodules and solitary nodules one nodule alone has a higher risk of being a modemancy. I know that I'm an anti-intreat those same kind of disorders. My biopsy came back as a papillary thyroid cancer. I was 34 years old. That point I had a four year old son and I wanted to have. And I was newly starting my practice. Probably knew I wasn't going to die because of this but I just had all these issues to face. I was in solo practice. I had to have surgery. I had to take time off. I had to care for my patients. I didn't really want anybody to know I was sick. Luckily I had a colleague and a friend who covered for me while I was needing to get my surgery and my radioactive iodine and all those things done. So it worked out okay but it really took a toll on me emotionally. Up until that point I was so focused on becoming a physician but I'd spent the last 20 something years studying for. I wasn't really seeing my husband much. I wasn't really seeing my children much. I just thought if this is what life is going to throw at you maybe I should live a little differently. Kampana D. Pesquali is living her life differently. She hired staff for her expanding practice and clinic and the skincare products don't consume much of her time which was partly the reason for doing them. It really didn't start initially like that. I would say it started more because it wasn't satisfied with what was out there but as I got to thinking about it it was kind of nice that there was something that I developed and created but didn't need to have my time every minute of the day like medicine does. Kampana's been learning to play the piano for several years now and is practicing to run a half marathon this winter. This is about the most balanced life has been you know I really do get to see my family. So I feel like my life is a lot more well-rounded where I have a career that I love. I think overall it makes you a happier person and I have noticed I feel like it makes me a much better doctor. This is closing the loop for WJCT News.
