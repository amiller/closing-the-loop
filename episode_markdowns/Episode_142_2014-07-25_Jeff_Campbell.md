## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Jeff Campbell was born in New York, but his family moved to Arizona when he was a teenager. That's where he learned to fly. My father pushed in a good way to succeed at different things, and one was pushed me to get my pilot's license. He had to put some money aside to do that. Jeff went to college and wanted to become a Navy pilot. There was a problem, however. Unfortunately, my vision is not 2020. All the military services required 2020 vision, uncorrected to fly. But Jeff learned a little more about the cockpit team for tactical fighters. There is a member of the Air Crew, a naval flight officer, although you don't get to be the pilot. You work at the weapon system, the radar, deploy missiles. You also do the navigation and communications. A lot of people have seen the movie Top Gun, and that's the aircraft that I used to fly in the F-14. From 82 to 93, and I had a chance to come back on active duty, but it was more inhuman resources and recruiting. And that's when his health issues began to appear. I started to climb physically, a shortness of breath, and just not being able to do the things that I normally could do. And I was writing it off to age. I just thought, you're getting older, getting out of shape. Certainly there was probably some of that, but it was being accelerated. I won from being able to jump to can only walk. And no matter how hard I was trying to get back in shape, I continued to climb. Jeff's wife, Laurie, is an active duty Navy officer, a Stanford trained engineer in what used to be called the C-Bees or construction battalions. Jeff has moved with Laurie on her frequent postings, which brought the couple to Jacksonville. A few years ago, Jeff was working out at the NAS Jacksonville gym, and almost passed out. They took me over to the emergency room, couldn't really identify anything until they put me under a stress test. Once they did that, they saw the EKG, they saw the spikes, they saw basically my heart was not firing properly. And ultimately it was blockages, they were blood clots that had migrated into my pulmonary artery and into my lungs. Earlier this year, doctors inserted a metal filter in the return vein to his heart, to guard against a clot in his legs traveling there. No one knows for certain what has caused the clotting. It is often associated with aviation as pressure differentials, varying your altitudes, especially in such a dynamic environment. But Jeff has seen an immediate improvement in his health, his energy, and his stamina. Now he's on to whatever's next. My wife has already got some plans for me. She's done triathlons all the way up to the Iron Man level, and has done very well. She's an impressive woman, still quite a way down the road. I'm still recovering pretty much all in doing these days, is walking until the heart shrinks down a little bit more. And he's deciding what opportunities he has for work, as with his health, there are hopes, but no guarantees, only opportunity. That's been a challenge. Any military spous, and it's typically your wife. There's more and more of us guys coming along now, because the ladies are stepping up into careers in the military. It is a challenge for many of us to try to hold any kind of steady career, and wherever you relocate to, in some case you have to start all over again. This is closing the loop for WJCT News.
