Jeff Campbell got his pilot’s license as a teenager in Arizona.
Although his eyesight wasn’t good enough to become a Navy pilot, he did become a flight officer on F-14s, the tactical fighter known from the movie “Top Gun.”
Jeff retired from flying. That’s when his health problems started.
Jeff has moved with his wife, Lore – a Stanford-trained engineer in the Seabees – and was in Jacksonville, when he almost collapsed.
He was diagnosed with blood clots, a problem associated with high-speed, high-G flying in tactical fighters. Surgery earlier this year has fixed much of the problem. Soon, Jeff will return to the ongoing challenge of finding wife as a military spouse ... and to running.
