# Transcribed Audio
And Shafers' life changed during a single week five years ago. At the beginning of the week, he was a motivated and successful salesman for a well-known truck manufacturer and he traveled across the country to accept an award. Top salesman, Wednesday in California, and then on Thursday we flew back where everybody dispersed and went back to their homes. Suddenly they decided that they did not need the top five guys in the country. On a Friday the top five guys in the country got simultaneous phone calls saying your service is no longer required. Fortunately, Dan had a background that had equipped him to handle change. I grew up throughout the world. My folks were missionaries with the Methodist Church, Cuba, Uruguay and Argentina, but I came back to the state side to go to school and then wound up in the military for a number of years and then into the trucking industry. When he was fired, it wasn't so much being dropped or the prospect of leaving trucking that upset Dan. It was that he was a salesman and he was good at it. I love sales. It's the best thing going. You get to meet people all the time. You have closure. But regardless of how good a salesman Dan Shafer was, he was now an employed. My better half says to me, I'm going to give you 72 hours to be about as upset as you can be. But somewhere in the 73rd hour, you need to come up with a solution as to what we're going to do when we grow up. So Dan did exactly that. He spent a few days thinking about what he could do. And it wasn't getting a sales job with another truck manufacturer. Instead, he dreamed about a long piece of bamboo with cuts in it that six-inch flower pots would fit into. Three or four o'clock in the morning, something came to me and said, this will work. I was able to get some bamboo and work this cut out to hold flower pots in it. Not knowing if this was something that was going to sell or not, I made a few. Dan took the bamboo flower pot holders to a couple of arts markets around Florida, and he sold everything he brought. That was the start of his company, bamboo creations. At first, it was something to bridge from where I am, to where I need to be. And now, it's at a point where the demand is great. Not only do I get to make what I'm doing, but I also get to sell it. The business has brought Dan and Carol a lot of benefits. They have made great friends all around the country. I sell these at art shows throughout the country. But I don't see it slowing down. But harvesting and working with bamboo is physically demanding work. Near harvesting, it had 90 degrees and 100% humidity. It is hard. And then we bring it back and we cut it to length. And then we have to lay it out for each of the products. And then every single one of these holes is hand cut. We're selling two to 300 pieces at each show. So he'll have decisions to make. Do I fear change or do I want to embrace it? And probably I'm going to have to embrace change. I mean, I'm getting up into my 60s now. I don't ever see myself just retiring and doing nothing. So I'm not sure what I'm going to do. Maybe I go back to selling. It'll always be something related to selling. This is closing the loop for WJC TNews. I'm more in military.
