## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Sherry Lifeford's family has been a northeast Florida for a long time. My family is one of the oldest families in Jacksonville. The Gilmore is at at Gilmore Heights, out in Arlington. My great great great great great great great grandfather, hopped off of a boat from Ireland and St. John's River and claimed most of Arlington. On the other side of the family owns a downtown business. My family has a business called Sikeson Stowe and St. downtown. My grandfather started it at Benarion 86 years now. Sherry went in a different direction for her career. I worked in the financial industry for many years. I started at 54 for site straight when Dean Weather was bought by Sears. But she left the industry a few years ago for multiple reasons. I reached a point in my career and I guess it's my age that I didn't want to be selling products to people just to generate a commission. Sherry also had something in mind that she liked to do better. I started with my clients making dips and rubs and handing them out to clients. At some point I said, well, I'm going to start trying to sell them. I started selling them at craft shows and I found out that they really sold well and I had lots of repeat business. And then I opened a website and the online presence has grown over the years. When I originally started and I thought I could turn on the website and people would automatically come and buy the product. But that's not how it works. I have to work in a little bit in 2008. I decided to leave the brokerage industry. So I went from stocks to snacks. Sherry life or business dips to go expanded and she opened a retail store in the Jacksonville landing. All of it has changed her life. It's been an amazing transformation for me. I don't have the corporate entity hovering over me. So I can grow this as I see fit, not as someone else sees fit. But she also lacks corporate support, not only funding, but someone to advise her on strategy. Fortunately she says she has her husband Mitch with whom she can talk about her business. We do. Every night, every night we talk about it. It's like what do you need to do to make this business successful? Sometimes I think while I'm going to start some type of group of young business owners just to sit down and have a round table. You know, what's working, what's not working. I think my little business is like a lot of people's businesses. You're at the point where you need to take it to the next level and how do you do that? Do you have the funds to go ahead and hire someone to help you with this? How much should you allocate towards growing the business with employees? It's a difficult decision to make. But Sherry does have one thing worked out. That's her exit strategy. The way that I'm looking at it is I'm growing this to sell it. I look at it as a little retirement fund. In five years, I hope to have quadrupled the sales that I'm doing now. Sherry has some ideas of what she'll do when she sells her business. Probably travel and move north to be around our grandchildren. They're in Connecticut. That's many years away, I think. And are only regret? I wish I had done this 30 years ago. Gone out on my own business. This is closing the loop. For WJCT News, I'm Warren Miller. Closing the loop is sponsored in Parkby first coast home pros with teams of specialists to clean your home.
