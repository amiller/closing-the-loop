## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Josh Kennedy has a backpack by his desk that he hasn't owned Pact since his last hiking trip. Josh is the owner of first-coast home-pro, so window cleaning company. He still looks like a college student ready to leave for a hike. Cleaning windows is something I did throughout college. When I graduated from school, most of my friends, you know, they were going to New York to be bankers, Chicago for law school, med school, corporate jobs. I didn't really want to do that. I made a decision to go back to work full time for the company that I worked in summers back in Ohio. I stayed there for a couple of years. Project manager there and they were a great company. I left because I just got really burned out. The grind was something that I just sort of had a quarter-of-a-life crisis and, you know, I've got to do something different. I spent two years traveling. I worked a summer in Maine as a camp counselor. That fall I went out to Arizona on a trail crew with at-risk kids. At that point, Josh was beyond running out of money. I think I had about $300 in my bank account. I had about $50,000 in credit card debt. My resume read something like statistics major, window cleaner, camp counselor extraordinaire. It was 2008, just as new hiring came to a standstill. But Josh had an idea of what he could do. When I was honest with myself about my skill set, I kept coming back to window cleaning and I had love the work. I went to kinkas, printed out some flyers, and I spent two weeks hitting the bricks, passing out flyers, lost about 10 pounds, and we've been busy ever since. Josh's business has acquired almost 5,000 clients, most of them homeowners. Growth was always a high priority for me. I had grown accustomed to living off of not very much. I just carried that mindset forward. And so every bit of the money I made and still to this day, I invest heavily back into the business for the purposes of growing. Josh Kennedy now has 22 employees. The key to running the business he says is the system he learned from his first employer. But Josh knows that he has to grow as well. What got me to right here isn't necessarily what's going to get me to the next step, whatever that is. For example, I spent the first year answering the phones myself. Mobile Office set up my truck and computer with internet access and both phones forwarding through to my cell phone. And the first time I hired an office person do administrative work only. That's a really hard step to take for someone who's in a service business. There are all kinds of steps like that to get from three people to six people to 20 people that have to happen. One of those growth areas is learning to plan. In the beginning, I started really one day at a time. Progressively grown more long-term minded. We're continuing to add new services to our offering. Josh's success is dependent on the quality of people he can hire. Having the right people in place to run the systems that we've created, that's by far the biggest challenge that we face in business. And though Josh is planning more long-term, he has less time to go hiking than he'd like. You know, maybe someday, but I sort of have to take what the business gives me right now. And time isn't necessarily one of those things. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
