## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
J.R. Berks has done a little of everything in construction. He's originally from Palatka and has done the groundwork of development all his life. My dad owned a pavement company when I was growing up. I would do a lot of extra work on the weekends and stuff like that. So I kind of always went out and found extra work. A little bit of everything concrete work, pavement, trim and trees. Then some of all of it. J.R. was working in the area that today is World Golf Village, even before its present owners took over. And I come near the building roads with my dad, my brother. And then the farm and market hit bottom, but I've done sidework often on for different people. I built course tracks and ponds and cleared land. J.R. and his son-in-law David started a new company. J.N.D. tractor work about 18 months ago. My daughter has kidney disease. The problem was where he worked. It was hard with her having to go to the doctor. And she had kids that had to get school and all this stuff. It was hard with a schedule to keep his job and take care of her and do what he needed to do. So we went in business doing dirt work and stuff. J.R. who's 55 has three other children. And they all helped take care of their sister. They've also run side businesses. My wife and my daughter had like a sandwich trailer that they went around and they do barbecue sandwiches and different stuff that they wouldn't pull out on the sides and sell sandwiches and stuff at lunch. Yeah, I guess we try about anything. Finding a niche for his new company has been a challenge. We tried to get into the pieces that nobody else wanted to do. We're putting up with a co-silp fence. That's the black stuff you see around the projects when they're working. And we've been doing that and that seems like it's doing better for us than anything. Another thing that's changed for the better is that under the Affordable Care Act, J.R. David and J.R.'s daughter all are covered under health insurance. David didn't have health insurance at his prior job. Didn't have health insurance where he worked. But she got some disability because she was working at the time and then she couldn't work no more. So she did get some disability that's helping with the medicine and stuff she has to have. Her company is keeping busy. J.R. Berks' priorities are family, not business success. He knows he can always find work. Comes down to how much work can you get in the support boat focus. He's the main one as long as it supports him and my daughter. I'm healthy. I can go out and get a job working for somebody else. That's what I've done all my life. So I'll probably go back into running a machine for somebody or something. The company so far has supported him and her. He keeps a week's paycheck and keeps him going so I'm in a field with that. Go find me something I need to. This is closing the loop for WJCT News.
