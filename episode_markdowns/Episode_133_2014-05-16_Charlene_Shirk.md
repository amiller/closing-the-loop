## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Charlene Scherke moved to Jacksonville after college to take an internship in the AdSales Department of the Local Television Station. It was 1991 and the Gulf War was underway. Every time I walked by the newsroom, something exciting was going on and I'd go back to my desk job and basically hung around until they hired me. She began the climb through a career in television. It involved a series of jobs and frequent relocation. Associate producer job assignment editor job went to work in a very small market, went to work in the Midwest. So I did it the right way. I climbed the ladder the way you're supposed to do and came back here for 10 years and then at almost 20 years total in the business started thinking what else can I do? Charlene's volunteer work in community contacts often brought her together with the PGA tour. The tour asked her to come by to talk. They said, look, we don't really even have this position, but we know that we need some help to get the community to understand what it is we do 365 days out of the year. So Charlene's shirt took the job of community relations for the players and eventually for tournaments around the country. The frequent travel once again prompted an evaluation, but a return to television wouldn't solve that problem. Do I really want to move to another city and start all over again and make new friends and get involved? I've lived in New York and California, Oklahoma and New Jersey and I just feel like Jacksonville just has a little bit of everything. And any thoughts Charlene might have had about moving were ended by an announcement from her mother. She had been diagnosed with stage two breast cancer. We went through two surgeries, full chemo, a full radiation that was pretty scary. Seven months after that we were one chemo away from her being through with that and on Super Bowl Sunday, 2010, my 39-year-old brother went to take a nap and didn't wake up. Her parents worst pain and worst fear is losing a child. The next worst thing is watching your parent mourn and suffer. Her mother survived in this cancer free today. Charlene survived too. To me the most valuable thing that came out of that was looking at your relationships. I have another brother who has three kids and they were living in Atlanta and they moved and they bought the house across the street for me and to have that gift of watching my nieces and my nephew grow up and have that relationship. I had a lot of girlfriends in this town. We'd always say, okay we're gonna get together, we're gonna go grab lunch, we'll do this. And we never did. We said it every time we saw each other at a committee meeting or a business meeting, who never did. Those women rallied around me in a way that I can never repay. And also looking at what I was doing eight hours a day. Did I really want to be away from my family and my friends and my community? The people who got me through this. So Charlene's shirt left the PGA tour to start her own company, doing what she's always done, building relationships. She also met a man whom she married. Who would have thought that the worst year of my life would be then followed by one of the best. If there's a benefit to adversity Charlene says, it's the incentive to realign your priorities. Being a great friend, being there when somebody needs you, being there for your family, being a good wife, being a faithful person, really taking in the moments and not letting them go by, not letting the days fly by without really appreciating the people in your life.
