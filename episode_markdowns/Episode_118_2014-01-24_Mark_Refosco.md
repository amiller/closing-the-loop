## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Mark Raphasco comes from Pittsburgh and went to school in West Virginia. I went to college for architecture, realized I didn't want to sit behind the desk all day long. Mark came to Florida and got a job first at the surveyor then with a home builder. He started his own custom home building company in 2001 as a franchise of Arthur Ruttonburg homes. Being a small independent during the boom had its own challenges. About 2003 Jacksonville was recognized as having more acquisitions by national home builders scooping up small home builders and so there was a frenzy going on in northeast Florida. We're building custom luxury homes. The nationals are taking all the labor force, all the manufacturing abilities in northeast Florida and I was the last builder that any these vendors really wanted to work for because our product was very complex and always different. The common wisdom is that the housing market in northeast Florida was fine until about 2007 or 2008. Well that's what people think but people recognize the boom as lots of construction activity. In 2005 sales abruptly stopped. Well all the builders, the national builders, smaller builders, we all had a lot of backlog in our system to build through 2006. We were still building our backlog and none of us thought that this recession was going to go on as long as it did. Once he completed building the backlog, the houses that had contracts and deposits, Mark Raphasco's business came to a halt. The most difficult times for 2009, 2010. We had to sell our personal home because it was too expensive for us. We moved in our rental home. Our lifestyle changed. We didn't go out to eat. We really had to tighten our belts and every way possible. And there were other things that Mark did to recover. I stopped reading reports about the economy because it really wasn't doing me any good. I knew what was going on with the economy. I was living it every morning when I woke up and every night when I went to bed and focused more on what I was going to do to survive. So I changed my business format. I learned about leverage. Today, I'm not leveraged at all. I don't want to conquer the world. I just want to build a few great houses a year. Make a good living. And I don't want to go out and borrow borrow borrow borrow. Like I was doing before. By the end of 2010, Mark had eliminated his debt, turning projects back to the banks that financed them. The problem was he had no work to do. But that began to turn around quickly. January 1st, we had two appointments. Both customers wanted to build a million dollar homes. We're on deadline to be under contract by January 21st. My wife who sells for me and I worked 16 hour days and we signed both of those million dollar contracts one on the 20th, one on 21st. Mark Raphisco also learned that he had more strengths than he thought. I learned patients tend to want to fix everything right now or I did. I had that mentality. Why can't wake up in the morning and fix this? Well, some things just can't fix. Something just have to write out the storm. And no matter what you do, it's not going to get that stormed and faster. Course life continues on. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
