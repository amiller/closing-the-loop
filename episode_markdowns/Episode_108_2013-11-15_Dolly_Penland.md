## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Dolly Pendlin was a writer and television producer for many years in Northeast Florida. After living in several cities around the south, she moved with her fiance back to Jacksonville. I was a producer at Channel 12 and loved TV. We decided to get married and I did PR for a little while because I didn't want to work overnight shifts. It's hard to have family and kids when nobody sees you. Dolly's alternative to working all hours in a television studio was to work all hours at her home. I actually fell into freelance writing. My former boss let me be one of the first people in the city to tell a community. Nobody even heard of telecommunications. I had a fax. I had a dial up. I was ready to rock and roll and I would do these advertising campaigns and press releases and stuff all for my house four o'clock in the morning. Dolly became best known for her writing in the Jacksonville Business Journal. The main thing that I wrote for them for 10 years was a business advice column that I loved. I was like getting my own mini MBA case studies every week for a decade. She also wrote about the arts for folio weekly. You talked to people when they're passionate about something. You get great stories. While writing about business, Dolly learned about behavioral assessment. Techniques to help a business make better decisions about who to hire. I'd written about behavioral assessment tools a few times. PI was one of the tools that I researched and read about because it was different than a lot of tools and that it was designed for selection. PI or predictive index is a branded questionnaire developed in the Boston area and licensed affirms across the US and globally. Dolly met the person who holds the rights to use it in this area and he asked her if she'd like to take the assessment herself. I took it. It took me like five minutes and he called me and he was telling me all about me. I was like, yeah, and your mother wears combat boots. You didn't get that from the little assessment. I am a very independent, hedge-drawn kind of person and didn't like that anybody knew all about me. Not long afterward, the recession hit media hard. Dolly Pendlin began looking for a new opportunity. One of the things that happened was that the advice column I had had to go away, the nature of the business, and I said, how can I still help business? That's what I want to do. What I love to do. What is the one thing that everybody has in common? People. It didn't matter if you have a restaurant or production company or a manufacturing warehouse. They all have people. She's probably remembered her PI test and with her characteristic lack of shyness, she called the owner of the company who'd given her the test. I just called Steve Waterhouse up out of the blue and I told him he needed to hire me. It works for me. I don't like to think of it as blood. I like to think of it as independent with a bit of firm, decisiveness thrown in with it. Dolly joined the company as a consultant. When you make a business money, money that they didn't realize it was accessible, like turn over. Businesses think it's a cost of doing business. It's not. And working how she likes to work, which is as her own boss. I am not employable and my PI does show that that gets back to that independent firm decisiveness. Dolly, Pamland has a good idea of what her own perfect job might be. It's this, I get to help businesses. When I first started writing that advice column, that was the thing that it just clicked in my brain. I loved it. If I'm helping a company and they call up their best friend who lives somewhere else and they say, oh my gosh, you got to talk to this dolly woman. That's the best compliment. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
