## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Mary Johnson, who makes cupcakes at her boutique bakery in the Mandarin neighborhood of Jacksonville, was a nurse at a major hospital and the daughter of a career air force officer. I was a nurse until about a year and a half ago. I was born in Germany, but I lived here my whole life. Her first decision was not to open a store, but to leave her job. I was just unhappy at work. I was there 40, 50 plus hours a week. I wasn't with my family. I was a little bit burned out maybe. I would come home and do these things on the side, do a little catering, and I, this made me happy. Cooking and especially baking was something with deep family ties. My dad and I used to bake together when I was growing up, just something we always did. Usually it was around the holidays. Sugar cookies and he'd made the ullogs, which were always really cool. Mary's friends and customers told her she should think about cooking professionally. I started getting busier and busier doing some parties, some holiday things. One of those people said you should open a bakery and I said I could never do that and then I thought, my can I? So Mary Johnson launched into entrepreneurship, opening the buttercream and moonbeams bakery last February. It was harder than she thought it would be. When you're selling food, it's a lot more involved for this small space we had to hire, an architect and a contractor. There's a lot of permitting that we really didn't anticipate. It took a lot more time and a lot more money. Mary has a table in the front of the store for neighborhood customers to hang out at and for her kids to do their homework on. In the beginning, I was here 60 plus hours a week. You think you know what your plan is but it really takes a while to figure it out. Now we have it down to a pretty good schedule. The kids go to school right down the street so I can always worst case scenario put a closed sign on the door and go pick the kids up. It's definitely become a family business. The kids are up here with me quite a bit. The table has people sitting at it quite a lot. Once we got opened, people have been wonderful to us. I think people really at this point appreciate a small local business. There's one thing about the business that Mary would change if she had to do over. I feel like I would have been better off if I went into this with someone that was as creative and invested and organized. That's been a big challenge because I touch every single thing that comes out of here and I don't have that other person that I can sit down and brainstorm with and say, oh maybe we should try this or I'm going to take a week off. But apart from that and even being a one-woman show, Mary Johnson still is amazed that she did it. It's easy to just get settled in your life with doing what you do and you get a paycheck and I think the fact that I actually did it, I still some days ago, oh my god I can't believe I did this. And she do it again. Most days, some days I think, I'm so glad I did it another day as I think. What was I thinking? But the feedback from people and the appreciation that people give us, I don't want to walk away from that. This is closing the loop for WJC Teenoos. I'm Warren Miller.
