Susan Frahm grew up in rural southwestern Minnesota, in the only county in the state without a lake. She became a nurse, married her hometown sweetheart, Neal Norton, and moved with him to northern California. Susan, Neal and their baby son, Cole, relocated to St. Augustine more than 30 years ago.
Neal, a musician, started a sound system installation and speaker re-coning business. When Neal died in 2006, Susan kept the speaker re-coning business going, as well her nursing vocation, which took on added levels of understanding and empathy.
