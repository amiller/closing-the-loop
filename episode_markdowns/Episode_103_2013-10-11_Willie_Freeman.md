## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Early each week day morning, Willie Freeman comes to his security job at the parking garage of a large office building in downtown Jacksonville and greets the people who drive in. How he got there and what he does when he gets off the security job in mid-afternoon are a 30-year story. I moved here in the latter part of the 1979 small time called Swain's Girl Georgia. My wife, now who was my girlfriend, we can't get because I had a relative here and I never lived around my mother. My mother didn't raise me, my grandparents did. I moved here so I could be around my mother. Willie got a job with Duvall County Schools. I had relatives that was in the school system, so they were able to connect me with Duvall County School Board. I was in the Duvall County Schools system for 21.8 years in the maintenance department. Willie Freeman did well at his job, but he was hiding a secret. I was a consumer of alcohol, drugs, marijuana. I became addicted to crack cocaine for about nine years. The amount of time he had. In 1992, Willie had a religious conversion and he quit taking drugs and drinking. His wife who stayed with him through those years played a key part in the conversion. About 14 years ago, Willie and his wife were called to ministry. We were a day and we went out to start our ministry. We've been doing ministry ever since. That didn't mean he quit his day job though. I've been working here for four years. I was on the security officer. I ministry is small, so therefore I still work in labor. And labor, you know, to help provide for my own means. And I don't depend on the ministry for that. You have to have a smart card to drive into the garage where Willie Freeman works. So he doesn't have to keep people out. Instead, Willie regards his security job as an opportunity to start his customers day out with a wave and a smile. And his influence in the building is substantial. All of the security in the office tower as well as the parking garage, make it a practice to learn the names of the people they see every day and to greet them by name. I'm a people personal. And as I tell people all the time, people are not my problem. They are my purpose trying to reach out, trying to make somebody else's day to give a word of encouragement. Even though at times, you got situations and problems and circumstances going on your own life. But little less, we learn to put the best on the outside. But who want to live this life if I look mad and sad all the time? So it's just a part of the change that takes place on the inside of a person that allows our light to shine in the midst of uncertainty and in the midst of trials and whatever we're facing. You know, because this is what's going to draw on others. I believe to a change of life too. As his ministry grows, Willie Freeman thinks so have to leave the parking garage job to devote more time to his calling. I hope in the years to come because I can stop working, don't secure it. And just do ministry full of time. As we continue the labor and reach out for souls and be a ministry, there's a need for more my time. This is closing the loop. For WJCT News, I'm Warren Miller.
