## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Dr. Onvou was born in Saigon during the last days of the Vietnam War. My father was in the South Vietnamese Army. In 75 when we lost, everyone was airlifted, all the officers, officers, wives, and families. And so Dad got first preference. But it was his mom, my grandmother, that said, no, I'm an old lady. My family's here, my ancestors are here, I was born here. You kids go on. My mom said, either we all go or we all stay. They stayed. Dr. Vue's father was captured and tortured by the Viet Kong and his family lived through difficult conditions. In 1980, when on was six years old, his father was released and his grandmother had passed away. The family planned their escape. We tried four or five separate times at each time we got caught. We finally made it. We were at Seve six days, without water for about two or three of those nights and days. There are pirates. They would basically loot and plunder the ships. It was a bad, bad experience. We were fortunate enough to get sponsored by a Catholic Viet Me's organization in Oregon and we flew out to the United States. Dr. Vue began his new life in Salem, Oregon. We went to move in with an aunt medical in Salem. I didn't see Dad for next two years. He worked three or four different jobs. Day, night, an occasional high and a buy right away. Thirty-six months later, Dad went up to the church with an envelope and said, this is what I think cost for us to come over here, plus interest. Hopefully this will help other families be as fortunate as we are. That was a proud moment for us. The family moved to Kansas where Dr. Vue's father could work in the meat packing plants. By then, Onvue was ready to go to college. He knew already that he wanted to be a surgeon. It was fortunate enough to have multiple scholarships and I got accepted my dream school, which is Harvard. But I did the math and it would have cost about $15,000 a year just to live there on top of my scholarships. So I stayed at university Kansas where they made me a very, very generous offer. Dr. Onvue went to the University of Kansas then to the KU medical school in Wichita. He worked at two level one trauma centers, putting in training hours comparable to his father's work shifts. He was drawn to plastic surgery for an unusual reason. At first, I didn't think that I wanted to be a plastic surgeon. I just knew that I wanted to be a and at the University of Kansas in Wichita, I knew that if I weren't there that I would be operating from day one, I wanted to be a training. What kept attracting me to plastic was instant gratification. With the other surgeries, you'd have to wait to see your results to see how the while they didn't see how well they healed. But with plastic surgery, you have a child with a cleft pallet. Everyone's stairs at the child wrong and they get with person stairs and other kids or afraid of them. After the five or six hours that were operating on the child, no one looked at that child any differently. Even though he's built a successful medical practice in St. Augustine, Dr. Vue still is driven and to something beyond professional success. I don't want people to think that my life is unique. There's tens of thousands of other Vietnamese kids like myself who went through what I went through. So I think that going forward, my number one goal is just to be a better person and to volunteer more of my time and to teach. I think that's going to be my next phase.
