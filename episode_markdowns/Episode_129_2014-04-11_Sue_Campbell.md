## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Two decades ago, Sue Campbell and her husband Jerry were running a family dairy farm in Clay County. The cemetery for their church, which is adjacent to the farm, was running out of space. Sue considered whether to convert part of the farm into a cemetery. At the time, it was 25 acres of dairy property that had been used for hay fields, and we converted it into a cemetery. That was the first step. It's a very emotionally charged or can be situation, and we just had no clue. We were farmers. We finally decided, okay, we'll go over to Talahasian talk to the department, the regulates it and just see what's involved in starting a cemetery. With their youngest child off at college, Sue and Jerry were looking to do something different. At that point in time, I had not had a job outside the home for maybe 20 years. I had no business training, my education, and my previous employment had been as a medical technologist. I think the main thing that was the thought of retirement will now be way in the future. Sue and Jerry Campbell were around 50 when they started the cemetery, and wanted to find someone to take it over when they retired. Their daughter needed a job after college. She came to work at the cemetery office, got to meet with families, and so she decided, hmm, I kind of like this too. But Sue and her daughter liked was the relationships. Sometimes it is very sad. I've never felt it was depressing, and I've never felt it was morbid. It's caring for people at a time when they are hurting and vulnerable, and I feel that we have served families honorably and carefully. They soon realized that they needed a full service funeral home. They became licensed as a funeral home with a small building at the cemetery, and then built a larger one that's now three years old. We could do a large funeral in a church, but there were other things that we had to do the embombing in another funeral home. We had to outsource cremations, and we really felt that families would be best served if everything could be done in one location. It gives them security. The funeral business is never far from the counseling aspect. Sue describes her first funeral. It was a family from our church, so I knew them at least, but it was for their four-year-old son. I remember thinking, I can do this, I can do this. After I was finished with the family, I just went to my car and cried like baby. My daughter's first encounter with a family, because she had been with me and met with families a few times, and I said, okay, the next family that comes in is going to be your family. The family walked in, I said, okay, you go meet with the family. I was in the next room, so I could hear everything. It was a family whose son had committed suicide. She got the same kind of introduction into this care and service business that I did. She handled it beautifully, the family still loves her. This is probably the benefit that we get from this, is knowing that we've helped the family. Most families don't have any idea of what's involved, and they'll call us and they'll say, I don't know anything. I don't even know what to ask you. And as we start talking and we get them to come in and they relax, then they become friends. We have made friends in this business that we would have never met every any other way, and they become good friends. This is closing the loop. For W.J.C.T. News, I'm Warren Miller.
