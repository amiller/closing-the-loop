## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Latoya de Grafrey grew up on the east side of Jacksonville. Nine years ago, she had graduated from Andrew Jackson High School. I was pregnant, my senior year, but I still graduated as the Marge as the deputy to press on in Phoenix High School. Latoya gave birth to a daughter, but started running with a bad crowd. A short time later, she was in federal prison. I got with a guy that was in the street life. I caught up with him getting a conspiracy charge. Federal relief, I did federal prison time two years. I was 23 years old in prison. Although Latoya didn't actually sell drugs herself, she was knowingly in the company of people who did. She served two years of a four-year sentence, then returned to Jacksonville to try to rebuild her life. First on the list, find a job. It was hard to find a job. First out of prison with a bike ground. Throwing a doors is getting closed in my faces like I wanted to give up. I came from a pre-and family that I know you can't give up. I got something better for you. So that was kind of motivated me to keep pushing. Without much success in finding a job, Latoya de Graffried was recommended by workforce to talk to ready for work. Nothing was working out when we were jobs. I had one job at me. It was on the game like two or three hours a day. I'm like, I call. She approached the program as she did school, which not coincidentally had been the last thing that Latoya had been successful at. I felt myself wanting to get up every morning. Got my daughter ready for school. I was getting ready for school and I didn't want to miss a day from class. One of the ready for work programs features is practicing the interview process. I was participating. I always thought, when we feel like we were ready, we're not ready. Do you think tell me that I went ready for an interview? And for anyone with a criminal record, even with the help of a program, finding a job is difficult. I was willing to do anything. I'll write that McDonald's, I wrote a daycare. I went to seven interviews here at like some recycling place. I went to a collection agency. Finally though, Latoya de Grafri found a job with a glass installation company. What she wasn't prepared for is how quickly the company promoted her. I'm a team lead. I work for a glass company and I work in the installation department. They interviewed me three times before I got this job. I'm still right now today to only warm in this on the floor. Walk around on the hard heads, geared up, chaps. I went all that stuff. Her employer didn't make anything easy for her. What Latoya's accomplished, she's done through hard work. She says she won't use job. She got the proof. I can't do that. I can't do that. But I never said I couldn't do them. I tried anyway. I made team lead before my 90 days on my job. And I'm still there right now. And she expects to be there for a while. She's doing something she's never done before, planning for the future. I'm five years. I still see myself with that company. I have been offered office positions. I've been offered other positions. I will not leave. I love out there. Hands on, just being busy is like I love it. I see me at that job for a long period of time. And after making the journey from high school to federal prison and back to a classroom, Latoya the Grafri has learned a few things. You never say what you can't do. It may seem hard. But if you apply yourself and you keep pushing us, then you can do anything. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
