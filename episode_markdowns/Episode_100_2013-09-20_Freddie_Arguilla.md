## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Freddie Arguelia came to this country 25 years ago. My mom gave me $500 and a plain ticket from the Philippines $500 is a lot of money. The wind of gone very far, but Freddie found work almost immediately. I was able to work for Eckhart's part-time at night and then I ended up working in a book binding company. Freddie didn't know much English when he got here, but he was a trained engineer and he understood how things worked in any language. A finished 5 year degree engineering course in electronics and communication. So I was able to learn how to fix equipment. I was able to understand how the machine operates because it's all about timing and the printing. So about setting all the cams, the timing and the paper goes in. You have to make sure that it's set properly. Within six months Freddie Arguelia was running the machinery. Five years later, he had an opportunity to come to Jacksonville. That's when I decided that I can open my own book binding company here in Jacksonville. Because I have family here. So in case the business doesn't drive, I have a place where I can stay. I started with three use bindary equipment, a cutter, a stitcher, and a folder. I think about $20,000 in investment. Freddie's binder he did thrive in the 1990s and into the last decade, but an increasingly digital and connected world signaled a permanent decline in printing. Most of my customers are printers. They don't have any work. My book binding doesn't have any work. And at the same time, Jennifer, my wife, being on her, we start looking on health care type of business. Because we feel that the health care is going to thrive. His break came in assisted living. It wasn't an opportunity given to us by a church member who owned a six-bed assisted living, which is Mandarin manner, which we still own. Freddie and Jennifer are Gilea owned two other assisted living facilities in the area and are impermitting for a third. And they have a good blend of skills. Jennifer deals more with the health care side of the residents and I deal more on the financial side. After three years of expanding heritage crossing step 51, and now legacy is only seven months old. We already acquired another property by saying Augustine to do another legacy. There's a need. People with Alzheimer's, 2030 will double from what we have now and then 2050, it will triple. So I think there's a need for something like this. Assisted living is not an easy business to run well. To paraphrase the football saying, customer satisfaction and assisted living isn't everything. It's the only thing. Banked people when they were doing study on heritage crossings and they've been talking to the family. Most of the comment of the family is the care. If you do what is best for the resident, they will first to their friends and me and Jennifer not corporate. It's only me and her owning this place. We don't have those big bucket to spend on marketing. What they do have though is the intangible required to succeed in the business theorem. You have to have a big heart taking care of old people. This is not something you're going to business because you want to make money. I think if you do what is right, money will come. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
