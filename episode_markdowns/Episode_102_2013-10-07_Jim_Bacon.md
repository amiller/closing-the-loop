## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Jim Bacon built a contracting business from scratch, lost it all, and it's starting over. And his first occupation hardly even exists anymore. I was a paper boy. We still hold the record at the Lansing State Journal for four paper boys in the same family at the same time. Big family, six kids taught the work ethic at a very young age. Jim expanded his paper delivery rude into a lawn mowing business, working for his newspaper customers. Eventually, Jim hardly laid that into a small construction company. I had aspirations of being a big bridge contractor someday and no money to do it, of course. No family background. And I just, with the ambition and the drive, I just started talking to people and begging them for bank loans and lines of credit and equipment loans. And before you knew it, I was a department of transportation qualified contractor. I had dozer operators making 3398 an hour and the life was good. His construction business grew steadily, but it was leveraged. Another recession hit and the government came in and lines of credit disappeared. The IRS showed up, did a look back. It was trying times. Not only was his business leveraged, Jim had entered into real estate development. We were setting the world on fire in a small Victorian town, northwest of Detroit. We were renovating old Victorian buildings, loft apartments, few delusions of grandeur. We want to be developers. And I wanted to build roads and bridges. I had done a white water rapids project for the city of Williamston, returning a river to its natural state, taking out the old rock crib dam, bringing in 13,000 ton of rock and boulders. The failure of the business strange, Jim bacon's marriage. Jim and his wife split up for a while, but they decided to put the marriage back together. Let's try it without all the chaos. The business and the 15 employees, let's try something new. Let's move to Florida. We move in 2002. All we had was a fifth wheel trailer and a pickup truck. Given away the Victorian home, the buildings, the cabin on the lake, everything went back. It was all secured. Today, Jim is doing the kind of work he likes best. I work with my hands. Occasionally, I work with my mind. I'm a hands-on guy. As long as my body can do it, that's just the type of work I'll do. And he's kept his marriage going. We've been together 26 years, through thick and thin. Jim learned a lot from his newspaper and long-care clients. They were presidents of corporations. They had private jets. They taught me that hard work does eventually pay off. A lot of them throughout the years shared their failures and how they started over and rose back and how tough it was to make something of yourself. We've those lessons in mind. Jim Bacon is waiting for his next break. It could show up at any time. We're alive. We're healthy. We live in St. Augustine. My wife and I are still going strong. I'm always looking for that next challenge and soon it will come. If I had to do it all over again, I think I'd do it exactly the same way. This is closing the loop. For WJCT News, I'm Warren Miller.
