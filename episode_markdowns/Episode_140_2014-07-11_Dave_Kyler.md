## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Dave Kyler is not an environmentalist by training. With a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering, an urban planning master, he came to St. Simon's Island on the Georgia coast for a job. He never left, although he didn't leave that first job. 96, I was working at the Regional Development Center where I'd worked for the previous 20 years. I was terminated without explanation. Mainly because the explanation was embarrassing for the executive director, fire me, by June of the Fall in 1997, I had started a grant from the Sappalo Foundation to start the organization that I've been in charge of ever since. That organization is the Center for a Sustainable Coast, an environmental advocacy group. Dave Kyler has made many connections over the years. Coastal scientists, policy makers at the University, few legislators, and various people who were sympathetic to a more environmental approach than some of whom I recruited as board members. Dave's engineering mindset and his patients at pouring through documents are well suited for today's environmental threats. The threat isn't the bulldozer. It's ink. Recent example, that is the Earth Day announcement by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, saying that they had reinterpreted a law that had been on the book since 1975 to mean there would be no natural 25 foot buffer along Georgia's title marshes. That was a strictly administrative decision, and that in combination with some other things, seemed to be a package deal meant to accommodate more intensive profiteering and coastal development in Georgia. Dave never married and has no family near his home. The organization he founded is very much a product of his work. The size of this organization and the role I play as executive director makes it an expression of my worldview and combination of my 37 years of experience in environmental planning. We have board members, some of whom were very active and a very robust understanding of issues and our better informed with some issues than I am. Dave Kyler had a triple coronary bypass three years ago. I drove myself to the hospital, it was a mile a can my chest, it just wouldn't go away. I have a lot more salmon than I had before the surgery. And stamina is important because Dave has a lot to do. I have a great privilege to be paid not lavishly but paid enough to survive to do what I judge to be in the public interest and share my views with like-minded people to shape public opinion. It's really a very fulfilling form of employment. A succession plan has been discussed but the center doesn't have money to hire a second person full-time. But Dave does have a long-range solution. The bulk of my net worth will become the endowment for the center. That endowment will help protect the 100 mile Georgia coast, which Dave Kyler describes as a unique environment with unique challenges. It has a disproportionately large amount of title marshes which are extremely productive. We have the irony of being one of the least developed coastal areas and yet a much lower conservation ethic among the people on the land. That's what creates the tension, the dynamic that makes advocacy more important here than anywhere else. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
