Warren Miller
Dave Kyler was trained as an engineer and urban planner. When he came to the Georgia coastal islands to work for a planning organization, he found a home that he's never left.Dave founded the Center for a Sustainable Coast, and has served ever since as an advocate for the unique tidal marshes on one of the least developed parts of the Atlantic coast.
His preferred tool is a well-timed and well-written letter to an editor, and his network includes politicians and developers, as well as scientists and university think-tank members.
Dave has never married, and intends to leave his net worth to create an endowment to protect the coastal marshes.
