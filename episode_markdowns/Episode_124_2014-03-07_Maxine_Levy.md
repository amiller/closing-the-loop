## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Maxine Levy is from Jamaica. Kingston Jamaica, that's where I'm born. She came to St. Augustine five years ago, because frankly, Maxine wanted a change. I was working with Bank of Nova Scotia, which is an international company. It was my first job, and I was there for 25 years. I think I was going through a crisis of, you know, really what does life have to offer me a part from just here. Maxine started to make plans to join her mother, and to bring her two sons. But her sons wanted to stay in Kingston. Some Maxine came alone. One of the things that drew me here, apart from my brother lived here, my mother was moving here, but I fell in love with Don'town St. Augustine. It reminded me a little bit of Jamaica, you know, pavers, historical places to stop and eat and galleries and so on. I felt that if I was migrating somewhere, I wanted to go somewhere where I would be able to reconnect. Once a month, I tried to go to Art Walk. It's a love of mine. I like to ride the trolley. I like to stop at the galleries. I like to eat, I must buy a waffle cone. I go to various things in Jacksonville. I remember of the Museum of Contemporary Art. I liked going to the museum. Art is something that I really love. Maxine, leavey, even draws when she thinks no one is watching. I have a little book that I scribbled stuff in. I used to love art very much, and I did very well when I was in school. It's something that I've carried along with me. A common misconception is that coming to the US is something that's done on a whim or quickly. Immigration is our process. It took me 10 years for that process to be completed. It's a goal of mine to become a citizen. This is actually a 15 year journey. Maxine also started a new career. She now sells real estate. It was something that I wanted to do years ago, but in Jamaica to be a realtor, you have to go two years full time. I started looking at different ways and realtor from where I am know. She called me to say that there were classes here. And I said to myself, opportunity knocks both ones. I said, this is an opportunity. Maxine leavey established herself in her new career very quickly, and is one sales awards at her company. But some things that we take for granted have been difficult for her, driving for example. It took me practically two years to not that I would drive on the other, but I have to concentrate very much to be on the other side. She also was used to walking out of a bar in Kingston with a drinking her hand. I didn't know that you could not go out. I mean, in Jamaica, it's no big thing that one was something I had to learn to do. I found that a bit daunting, adapting to a different culture. Starting over in a new world is never easy. I'm away from friends. I had to start a just to getting new friends. So relocation is a difficult process. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller. I don't know what it means to win. Come down to me again.
