## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
When Matt Green graduated from high school, he was given a choice. It was either a go-get-a-job or learn how to fly. That's because Matt is part of the third generation in his family to take to the sky. His family's business, infinity aviation, is located in a hangar at St. Augustine Airport, in which the greens have a small fleet that ranges from a sesnus citation jet to helicopters and even a float plane. My grandfather just did it for fun. My family was never in the military. My grandfather, I think, heard it on the radio. A long time ago, and he got his and then inspired my dad. My dad, when he actually created the flight department to use for his electrical business, he would use it for travel and business purposes. And then when he retired, we just kind of bought out the flight department for the family and have been just doing it for fun since then. Although he's been around aviation since he was born, Matt did not want to be a pilot. Let alone do it for a living. I've been to art school. I've done a lot of other stuff looking for what I wanted to do and I wasn't until I came back home after college and took a helicopter lesson. And as soon as I took one lesson, I might as well as this is what I'm doing. This is the most incredible thing ever you know, I'm hooked. He got his licenses for both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. Matt started teaching and doing aerial photography. My schedule is pretty open and pretty flexible. What I'm working on right now is getting our charter certification to fly people for higher. I'm not allowed to fly a person for higher from one place to another. I'm allowed to take off fly around a comeback here. So I got to get a special certification which has been a year and a half in the process now of getting a charter certification to fly you from one place to another. Matt's license to fly everything in the family fleet, but he doesn't hesitate when asked what his favorite is. Definitely helicopters. That's my passion. 100%. And he's taken ownership of that part of the business. Infinity helicopters is my own business. So it's just me and the R44, which is one of the helicopters out there. I make a little bit of money. Really it's not a four-high business. It's more of just a good pleasure thing. Matt's father was very successful in the electrical business he sold. The family members as a result have the financial means to pursue their interests without worrying about short-term profitability. I was really stressed out as a kid that I was going to have to do something I didn't want to do when I got away. I was always afraid I was going to have to make that compromise. I went to art school. I was a bike messenger. I did it for a few days and I couldn't keep up. But with flying Matt's found something at which he can keep up. I know we're more so than piloting a helicopter. You're just very free I guess. There is an airplane. It's a lot more procedural. You have to land and take off on a runway. You have to use people at certain time. You can't fly this low. As long as you're not in dangering people are property on the ground, we have the freedom to do just about anything. That freedom takes care of another of Matt Green's childhood thoughts. I had a lot of dreams when I was younger, flying around. Inside my house, dream flying. And the helicopter seems to be the closest to that floating mid-air. And just going wherever you want. Land there, land there. It doesn't have those dreams anymore. I don't know, I guess because I've made my fulfill it. The older I've gotten, I dream a lot less now. So it never really gets old. It's an amazing feeling. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
