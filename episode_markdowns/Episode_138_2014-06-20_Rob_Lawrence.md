## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Rob Lawrence is in commercial real estate. He started his career in it and was lucky enough to find a mentor early on Henry S. Turner, who taught Rob the business. He's a great guy. Show me the formula for success, which is very simple. The hard part comes in with the execution. Condition yourself to come in every day, make those cold calls, be prepared to take no foreign answer several times before you get a yes, and stick to it and eventually things will come around. Rob did well for a while. After 2002, things started picking up a bit in H.S. Turner. We made some changes. He wanted to get out of the brokerage business. So we merged with any I real vest out of Orlando. We did pretty well for a couple years there. And then when the market started going down, real vest aside, or pull out of some of the markets that they had expanded out of. And Jacksonville was one of those markets. Rob and some friends took the any I brand to Kushman Wakefield, but the market continued to drop. Eventually they broke up the business. Several years ago, Rob found an opportunity with another company that did want to be in Jacksonville. I have a friend down in Miami who had a real estate company. He had some holdings up here in Jacksonville. He and I got together and opened a branch. It was a tough time to start a business. Very tough time. We realized that for the next couple years, we weren't going to get a whole lot of cash flow. Our strategy was to lower our overhead, cheaper office space. You go down to bare bones of what you absolutely need. We've actually been working in the black. We've never lost money since we've been in the business for the last three years. We're not blowing the doors off anything, but we are keeping our doors open. Keeping the businesses doors open has entailed changes and sacrifices for Rob Lawrence, his wife and his two children. My wife works. She's an administrator at a local college. So she's helped pay the bills. You start questioning yourself and asking, hey, am I doing the right thing? Is there something I can be doing better? So what I've ended up doing is shifting my focus and the real estate industry from industrial leasing and sales to get into land development. And he's not immune from wondering at times whether it's worth it. A question at all the time. But I do enjoy it. I enjoy going after the deals. I enjoy working with people. I enjoy problem solving. And believe they're not, I enjoy working with the other brokers and jacks in bill. Really good people. We get along well. And we all would like to do the deal. Yeah, we butt had some times and we can't come doing a agreement. But I enjoy working with these guys. The thing about real estate development is projects can take a long time to be finalized and for money to change hands. That's not going to happen overnight. We make concessions and do what we have to do to get to where we want to go. I had a whole bunch of hobbies that I enjoy doing. And yes, I have had to stop them. I used to teach and do type one day with the boys, kayaking, biking, hiking. I also took on a part-time job to make ends meet. His part-time job is a security guard at NAS Jacksonville. Tomorrow weekends are shot. A holidays are shot. And then during the week, I get to try to get my business back on track. But in the end, Rob Lawrence keeps his mentors advice in mind. I'm going to stick this out and see it through. Right now, it is starting to get back on track. I do see it turning around. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
