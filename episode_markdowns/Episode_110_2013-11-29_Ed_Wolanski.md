## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
10 years ago, Ed Willandsky was an auto technician in Jacksonville, working long hours, and his wife Laura was an office manager. They had teenagers and though not terribly religious, they went to church. Then things began to change. What changed was that I started to feel that what we were doing with the youth at our church wasn't enough. It was too much fun in games. So Ed started a youth center in the St. Nicholas neighborhood in Jacksonville. During a few hours, he wasn't working. We didn't plan on doing what we're doing. We thought that we were going to produce an out of the box youth-oriented church. What we figured out was that religious truth doesn't mean much to somebody who doesn't have enough to eat unless it is a solution. After we moved into this neighborhood, we realized that we had a group of kids that weren't getting enough to eat, that had no male role models, and the role models that they did have were not good. They're very transient. They move around a lot. We'll pick up and move in the middle of the school year. More than once, some of them. Some five years later, Ed's in Laura's center provides tutoring to kids in the neighborhood. We are called the pulse, and that comes from if you have a pulse, you have a purpose. We do several things. We offer tutoring, K-12, most of these kids are at a high risk dropping out of high school. The younger that we can start them believing in themselves, understanding that school is important. The younger that we can start them realizing that dropping out of school is a very bad idea, then the more likely they are to stick with it. We solicit schools. We have been connected with teachers who knew other teachers, and so we have a couple of retired teachers that come in and high school students and college students that will come in. We do tutoring three days a week. Some of the kids who have been tutored at the pulse have gone on to college. One girl who was born in Haiti now is preparing to go to graduate school in social work. When a child has an inner drive, we've got to put the right ideas in their head about where to apply that energy, because they can very easily imagine themselves being a artist or a professional football player, and the likelihood of making a good living out of either one of those two things for a particular individual's slim. The center runs entirely on donations. A few years after he started the center, Ed will ask he suffered a serious back injury that was not related to his job. Several surgeries later, he no longer could work in its prior occupation and started to run the center full-time. My wife was working and she could carry us. We lost that comfort zone in our finances, and we were taken in donations at that time, but it was very limited. So in order to finance the reconstruction of this unit, I ended up catching out my 401k a couple years later. She was laid off from her job. We ended up catching out her 401k. So we really invested everything we had in it, and I believe that that was the reason why some people who saw what we were doing and how committed we were decided that they would also support it. The transition from a skilled professional to operator of a faith-based non-profit has brought major changes to not only the Willancki's financial profile, but to their mental one as well. I have come from having criticism for folks who are in need, having been in this neighborhood for four years now, having been stripped of our comfort, it's kind of opened my eyes to the light of people who are less fortunate. We tend to take for granted what we have while we have it. I would work very hard and I kind of worshipped my job and my money that was my life. Coming to where we are now, I can see that there's a lot of things that are more important. This is Closing the Loop for WJC TNews. I'm Warren Miller.
