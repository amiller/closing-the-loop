## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Jeffrey Oliasimi really loves the hotel business. Born in Armenia and growing up in Houston, he went to college to learn something completely different. I went to college for medical technology. I was in hotel business restaurant business, while I'm going college. And I figured out that that's a better business to be in than medical technology. I finished college. I stayed in a hotel business and I've loved it since then. And that's now almost 30 years. Jeffrey knows exactly what he likes about the business. Everything. It's people. And in a hotel business, it's just fun because they are coming to have fun. Whether it's business or pleasure, they're coming to have fun. So if you was to have fun with them, you're working all day and having fun. I mean, how could you go wrong? Jeffrey has worked for Marriott for more than 20 years. Not even relocation is dimmed his enthusiasm. I left our area and went to Oklahoma City for three years, because the company wanted me to go and do something for a hotel that needed some new directions and new help. I went to Oklahoma City and I loved it. Great culture, great people there. His family knows that travel is part of, well, the travel industry. I remember when we moved from Orlando to Ponta Vigio, one of my daughters was a fifth grader, the other one was second grader. And they cried and cried because they were living their friends from Orlando. And I said, girls, we can go back. It's only two hours, but they knew that's the way of life. I know people, more than being my own brother, I have moved probably five or six times. He has moved over 20 times. And he's got two little kids as well. He'll tell business you get up and go. Jeffrey Oliasam is vision of retirement is like that of many other people, travel. The difference is, in Jeffrey's case, it's not much different from the rest of his life. I would love to stay as a consultant and help and maybe do some educational things go through some of the universities that have hospitality school in him and try to teach our young generation tell business. Because there's a lot of change in hotels. When I used to check into a hotel room, if I had a block radio, I was happy and a TV. Kids now, they're not kids anymore. Some of them are in their mid 20s and they're professionally working. They want internet that is just as good as they have at home. They want 45 channels on their TVs. That's the technology that most of our hotels don't have. And we just have to change. The concept of embracing change while maintaining consistency is what Jeffrey wants to teach. Every customer's different, every group is different. I think what I would be able to teach him is how to read your people, your customers, and be able to offer them what they need. That's something he cannot learn from a book. But if someone can learn to read people, the rewards of the hotel business are more than financial. A medical technology you would go to an office or a hospital room, small maybe eight by 12 and do technical things and then you could go home. And in hotel business, you've got all the restaurants and bars and in many cases, golf courses and museums. So you could enjoy all of that while you're having fun with people and of course people are spending money. It's all great. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
