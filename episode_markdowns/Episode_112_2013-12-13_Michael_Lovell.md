## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Michael Lovell was born and raised in Barbados and came to the United States for college. I went to undergraduate school in Boston and study pharmacy and then came down to UF and did a PhD in pharmaceutical analysis. After graduate school I went to Syracuse, New York, I met my wife, Kathy, we both worked for Bristol Mars, went up to the Midwest and worked for Abbott and Ciro and then went back to Boston to work for Arthur D. Little, that's the point at which the entrepreneurial bug bit me. Arthur D. Little is the oldest consulting company in the world founded by a Boston chemist. Michael started a contract research company with two associates and sold it in 1996. A few years later he started his own contract research firm. I was fortunate in that I traveled the US quite a bit but I also had the opportunity to go to Sweden, Germany, the UK. Still haven't seen London even though I've gone through it for many as 10 times. In the years when Michael Lovell was traveling the pharmaceutical world he became aware of interesting work at his former university. I started coming back to UF for the corporate leaders weekend and vertebral holiday research that was going on at UF. Thought about coming back to move some of those technologies into the marketplace. I met some folks at UF who had started an angel investment plan and both Kathy and I decided that we would become part of that. And then in 2004 we started seriously looking at coming back and finally made the transition in 2006. Michael and Kathy settled in St. John's County near the river but Michael didn't pursue his work in Gainesville and during the recession cut back on his traveling. The technologies that I started to develop care mode of Tampa the Muffet Cancer Center rather than UF. A lot of my time now is focused on risen funds to commercialize the technologies that we licensed from Muffet. A lot of that has done from home. Michael's current group is comprised of two friends from his Massachusetts days. One is still up north. The CEO lives in Jupiter and Florida and Michael works from home. We're a virtual company. We wouldn't have any laboratories. We'll use contract manufacturers and we'll use CRLs for the clinical testing. It is in fact an ideal situation for someone with local tastes but a global network and working in a global industry. Yes, I can live in an area of the highlight. Visit colleagues when it's necessary but once we raise the funding a lot of my work will be with contractors who are all the state. Michael level is excited about his current work and expects to continue doing it for his loans he can. It's a technology that has potential to treat cancer as well as kidney diseases. An entire year's time, hopefully we would have gotten three of our four technologies into the new proven that their helpful to patients. Golf is only follow five hours a day. There's still a little time to continue to do what I'm doing. Even though his work doesn't involve UF, he doesn't mind living close to it. Very rarely do I go into games where that's that far home coming and the football game. Once a geter, always a geter. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
