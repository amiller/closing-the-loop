## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Darrell English grew up in suburban Los Angeles, moved with his family to Louisiana and for his father's defense job, enjoying the Navy after high school. He became a satellite communications expert, knowledgeable about special warfare and cryptography and stationed at Mayport. When his enlistment ended, Darrell met with a Navy Transition counselor and he told the counselor he needed only a pretty small income. Transition counselors, the ones who were supposed to help you transition from military to civilian, he seemed to think that with all the schools all the training that had the military wouldn't translate to a civilian position and was telling me I won't make much money, I would have to find something else to do, that there was no demand for what I was doing, which was kind of a shock after 20 years. Darrell ignored the counselor and started his next career on familiar ground. I got to get it with a friend who had gotten out right about the same time and we got contacted by a government contractor in California. They offered a position and I went back to Mayport where I retired too early in civilian clothes. They were almost twice what he said I would not be able to make. With the head start, Darrell and his friend became civilian tech guys. We knew it was only good for a year or two so we started taking Microsoft exams because at the time. A certification with Microsoft as a systems engineer was the hot thing. Darrell worked for a number of years with a Jacksonville contracting company, maintaining the computer systems of major businesses in the area. One Thursday afternoon they came in about 3.34 o'clock right as we were all coming in from our jobs and we're met with a group of people who said we want you to pick up your personal belongings. We'd like you to vacate the premises and don't come back. Darrell couldn't find a job without leaving town. My wife's sister is a nurse and I used to spend hours watching these medical shows on TV so she thought well you have this interest in this medical field you like working with people. You've been teaching CPR 15 years now. I don't know if you become a nurse. I kind of looked at her like you want me to be a nurse, predominantly female field. Going from a strong electronics, back ground, computer, back ground and I looked at her and I said okay. So Darrell English went to UNF for his bachelor's degree in nursing. Then to Florida to earn a master's for his advanced registered nurse practitioner certificate. As a nurse practitioner I can evaluate and prescribe anything but control substances. Elected in more involved in the treatment care that you were. Our ins we usually fall the physician's orders. After a back injury that required surgery, Darrell became interested in pain management and works in that field today. He admits that is more than 20 years in electronics delayed finding his true vocation. If I would have known that this would have been such a good fit for me I probably would end in the Navy as maybe a medic. But at the time when you have a recruiter who's saying I'm going to give you all this money if you come into our new nuclear power program because we really need people it's hard to turn down several thousand dollars. The expression one door closed is another opens. Well in my case one door closed I had to kick another door open to get where I wanted to be. That's fine that's just my personality. Darrell's now working on a doctoral degree. I'm actually looking more into changing my doctoral program to a doctor in education because when I think of closing in loop or coming full circle and a few years my plans are to get into an education position and kind of give back especially to Jacksonville. They gave me all these opportunities. I want to get back into teaching somehow. This is closing the loop for W.J.C.T. News. I'm Warren Miller.
