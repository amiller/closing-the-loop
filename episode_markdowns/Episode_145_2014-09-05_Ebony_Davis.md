## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Ebony Davis, who was born and raised in Dayton, to beach, was a social worker with a rising career. I was moving up, I was working for a city commissioner, I was working for the biggest treatment center in Valucia County and working in the development office, and going to school for my masters in social work. I mean, things were going good. But that's when Ebony, who had had drug problems as a teenager and was in a recovery program, started to slip. I stopped going to meetings and I stopped making my recovery like top priority. All of a sudden, I was faced with a choice. If you want to go hang out with the mayor and go to this city council meeting, or do you want to make your home group meeting? Our first got clean when I was 19 and did the stuff that people who get clean the stay clean do. I went to school, I started contributing to my community. I started getting property and more responsibility. And then I stopped maintaining my recovery. Ebony Davis began to suffer from anxiety attacks, and she got a prescription for Zanix. That led to relapse and a new addiction. She imbezzled money from her employer. She was indicted and convicted. I had to go to prison for six months. I had never been a prison before. They put my picture on the front page of the Daytona Beach News Journal. Daytona being so small knew that, and the whole would give me a chance everybody knew my name. A friend told her to come to Jacksonville for a fresh start. Her probation officer told Ebony to talk to ready for work. A nonprofit that helps nonviolent offenders prepare for jobs after their release. Most of all, the organization helps ex-offenders practice answering the question. Have you ever been convicted of a felony? I mean, I didn't know how to deal with that. I just would lie and say no, they would want to hire me. And then they would get my background and then call me and say, why do you lie about that? Why did you mislead us? What make me feel worse about my situation and more hopeless? Her case worker made sure that Ebony followed the system. I went to ready for work every single day, and I would dress professional like I was going to work every day. We would do mock interviews. I would tweak my resume. I learned a whole bunch of skills about just staying focused and how to answer that question. Some days I just didn't want to, but I did it because she believed to me. She knew that one day I would be okay. Then in HR director she knew told her about a position at a program that helps other felons qualify for work. It allowed me to go back and help convict that felons until they could clear their background and go to school or whatever. Have you been to Davis herself went back to school and as on track to earn her master's degree this December? None of it has been easy for her. You have the person here. There is nothing so bad that you cannot overcome it, nothing. Because I felt like that plenty of times I'll never be able to get a good job and look at this amazing. I remember being in prison really believing that my life was over. What am I going to do now? And I hear it is I'm getting ready to graduate. I mean it's just unbelievable. Her own life is provided both training and credibility for the work of helping others who think their life is over. Just keep trying because somebody is going to give you an opportunity. You have to believe in yourself. And you have to show up no matter what. And show up and be honest. That's the thing. That's the hit because people appreciate that. I got the door sland my face quite often. No, no, no, but then I got that one job. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
