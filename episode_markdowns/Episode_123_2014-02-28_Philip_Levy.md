## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Philip Levy had trained as a teacher in New Jersey, but after a teacher's strike, he went back to school for a master's degree in technical writing. Technical writing brought him to Jacksonville. We moved down here in 89 to be near my wife's family, and I got a job as a technical writer. And then that company was moving to Ohio at which point I was able to hook up with a medical insurance company. And I was there for five and a half years, at which point I decided to see if the grass was greener and go to a smaller company in the benefits and administration business. The customer service team that Philip was part of stayed the same for many years, but its corporate ownership began to change with dizzying speed. Most of the time I was there, we were joined venture of state street bank in city group. Then state street bank pulled out and then it was just city group and then when city group had their financial crisis, then loaded us to the Dutch outfit ING. And then ING in turn had their series of bad loans. Eventually the financial meltdown reached Philip as well. I was there for about 12 years, survived countless layoffs. And then my ticket was finally punched, I guess, in the end of June of 2010. Philip thought about returning to teaching. I had this sort of romantic notion of returning full circle to teaching even though I realized it was a different world. And when I taught many moons ago in New Jersey, it was hired by Duval County to work at one of their intervened schools. And grateful that the principal was willing to take a chance on somebody who'd been out of the teaching industry for many years, but had solid corporate experience. Philip has been teaching high school English for the last year and a half. A lot of things he really enjoys about his new profession. I like the kids, I like the interaction, my kids are off at college, so still dealing with kids on a daily basis. You know, some of them have many challenges and they don't come from necessarily easy backgrounds or how to pushy. But I like the fact that I'm hoping that I've reached some of them. I'm not sure when you know if you've reached them. I felt good for instance when I returned this fall my second year. Many kids came up to me and seemed happy to see me to see that I had returned, which is sort of interesting to me because some of those students seemed to seem happy to see me. Yeah, and I didn't think that I was there. They were teacher last year. In fact, Philip's time in the so-called real world gives him some leverage in the classroom. Having been a parent, having been in the business world, having been a professional writer. I have a lot of different things that I can offer to the students. I mean, I know they're drawn to some of the young teachers who they have, but I think they appreciate my sense of humor and what I bring to the table. Philip made a quick decision to return to teaching, not because he needed a job, but because of the school calendar. On the job as a high school English teacher, Philip has come to not only survive, but to thrive. You know, certainly feel more comfortable the second year you never feel totally relaxed. It's a tough position. It's a rewarding position, but it's a tough position in being in a school that's under constant scrutiny. Makes it challenging and adds to your things in the back of your mind. But at the end of the day, I think it's a worthwhile and somewhat noble thing to do and I hope that I'm making an impact on somebody's life. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
