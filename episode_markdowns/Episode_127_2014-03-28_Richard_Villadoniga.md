## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Richard V. Adana got teachers at a middle school in St. John's County. He's taught subjects from geography to Spanish. My first job teaching was 1999 as a science teacher at Switzerland Point Middle School. I was raised in St. Augustine. I was born in California but moved to St. Augustine when I was 12. Came back home after college. Found a job teaching. And that might have been Richard's entire story, except for his outside interest, which got it unexpected but powerful boost a few years ago. I've always had an interest in writing and particular about food and travel but that didn't come around until 2007. What kicked it all off was winning the Jeffrey Roberts Award, which was an award out of England given to one person who comes up with a project that benefits the world of food, wine, and travel. The project that I pitched to them was to travel across the United States and document the endangered foods of America. Somehow they fell for it and awarded me this prize and we embarked on a 27-state journey, some erode trip close to 15,000 miles that summer. We met with ranchers and farmers and chefs and we visited farmers markets and you name it and we learned all about folks who are working to preserve some of our most traditional and rare foods. Richard and his girlfriend is now his wife and the mother of their infant daughter got a crash course in the country's cuisine and its sources starting in his own hometown. We kicked it off right here in our own backyard. St. Augustine has the the Dattel Pepper, which is just a very unique little pepper-notch-grown commercially anywhere else. The Minorkins are closely associated with that pepper. Kind of started wondering why it's not grown another parts of the country and what the history and connection is there to our area and we learned quite a bit. The more we traveled the more we were able to document, more these amazing fruits, vegetables, livestock, slices that are parts of our American cupboard. When he returned, Richard had a new interest beyond just travel food and wine. He became a culinary environmentalist. Being exposed to all of this stuff made me come home and say why aren't we doing more locally to preserve our culinary heritage? Start a chapter of slow food here and on the first coast. I actually resigned as the leader of it this past year with the birth of my baby daughter. Richard via Donica returned to teaching and the road trip didn't have a big impact on his job. In the beginning it did because I was teaching geography and so I was able to incorporate a lot of that into my curriculum but for the last three or four years I've been teaching Spanish. I'm still continuing dabbling and writing and I actually just got back from a cookbook seminar in Charleston, South Carolina. And when he resumes writing it will be about food that's close to home. I've got some projects up my sleeve that I'm thinking about focusing more on Florida foods and Florida food ways. It is a very diverse state. Some might even say the most diverse state in terms of our culinary heritage with so many different groups that live here and brought their foods to the Floridian Table. This is closing the loop for W. J. C. T. News. I'm Warren Miller. closing the loop is gonna be at one spark. Come see us in the River City gourmet shop in the Jacksonville landing.
