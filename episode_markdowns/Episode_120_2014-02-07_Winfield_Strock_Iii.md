## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Winfield struck grew up in West Virginia, the ideal recruiting grounds for the Navy. I was a kid that didn't know what he was going to do, didn't know how he was going to make a living, but my parents made it pretty apparent that I needed to move on and become an adult. I don't think I'd finished growing up yet, so the Navy helped me do that. Made two decisions back then. One was joined the Navy and the other was marrying my wife Cindy. Winfield's wife followed him up and down the East Coast, Groughton Connecticut, Norfolk, and eventually to the submarine base at King's Bay, Georgia, just over the state line. I showed him King's Bay in 1993 when I was part of the commission in crew of the USS Rod Island. About a house there since then and I've transferred away once or twice, but in the end when I retired out of the Navy, that's where we were. I tried to go back to West Virginia, but job fair, which all they said was unless you want to go in the coal mines or be a corrections officer in the prison, there's nothing for you here. At age 42, Winfield's stock was cut loose from the Navy. Too young to retire, but with no idea what his next career would be. You get a pension, but I need to find another career. Pensional loans, not gonna pay the bills. I'd turned down a $10 an hour job in West Virginia for a $7 hour job in King'sland, and I worked at the comfort end from 11 at night till 7 in the morning. And that quiet time was not a lot to do, gave Winfield time to think, and to write. I had a real hard time with just a big part of my identity being gone. I wanted to find something that I could identify myself with that was more me than being in the Navy was. I took on the hobby of writing while I was at the night desk at the hotel, and it kept me awake. Winfield left the hotel job for other work. A short time later, he went to see a doctor. I was showing symptoms of having a brain tumor. At head to brain tumor for a while, but as a meningioma develops inside your head, you really don't know you have it until it starts crushing other things. This one had wrapped around the optic nerve of my right eye and had started to strangle it. It was benign, it came down to UFCans in December 2007, had some complications when into a brief coma and came out of that okay. But it was a close enough brush with death to change a few things in how Winfield's stock looked at his life. It wasn't like a light bulb went off, it wasn't like letters in the sky, but I realized I don't want to take what I was doing seriously. My first two novels are alternate history. Their science fiction, but their science fiction set in the past. It took me three years to finish the first one and it took me a year and a half to finish the second one. What I'm working on now is a Cold War era submarine with a vampire on board. A number of occurrences told Winfield that he'd found something on which he could build a new identity. Saturday morning, I'm right in a way. I noticed my hands are shaking and I feel really kind of ill. And I look at the clock and I'm like two hours past lunch. So I got up in a eight, but as I was eating, I got kind of elated because I realized that I found something I loved so much time melted away. The process of writing, the investment of energy has brought physical changes to him. My emotional state is a much wider swinging pendulum that. Like when I call my wife to see if I need to bring home some eggs or my home from work, I get overjoyed just to hear of a waste on the phone. When we get an argument, I get flamen mad. So there are adjustments that have had to be made because of the trauma that I'm upbringing. But most of everything works. When I go to conventions, I love talking to people about diving in and finding something that gives them that kind of passion because to me, you know, it is a big chunk of life that not everybody realizes is there until they dig down and find it. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
