## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
12 years ago, Melinda Henry was running the finance department of a car dealership in New Jersey. She left the job to become a physical trainer to mentor her two athletic daughters. My daughters were in high school, they ran track, they played basketball, and they played volleyball. The trainer said, well, going work out, he told the girls, and he took the guys, and I thought, wait a minute, if my girls are athletically enough to receive an athletic scholarship, and he's not going to help them, then that's going to have to be my job. So I started taking my girls into the gym, we started working out, and we started liking it. So Melinda became a certified trainer. A few years later, she moved to Jacksonville. I do have family here. My sister had the only African-American bookstore here in Jacksonville back in the 80s, and I liked the weather. She worked as a trainer with several of the national name gems, and with a personal training company. But like most entrepreneurs, Melinda didn't make a very good employee, and she thought that in the African-American community, working out, solved only part of the overall fitness problem. One of our clients came in and said, the doctor said he needed to reduce his blood pressure, or she was going to put him on blood pressure medication. The routine that we worked in the consistency that we worked, and the nutrition that we added into it, after 12 weeks, the blood pressure was down and stable. He no longer had to take his medication. So Melinda decided to tackle the wider health issues in her community. In 2008, just as the recession was setting in, she bought one of the gems at which she had her training practice, located in a large space at the back of Gateway Center, a nor would have known. She used every sense she had, and every sense she could raise. My love for what it was that I was doing and what I wanted to do seemed to help find the resources to do what we needed to do in the community. So yes, we did. We pulled together our Nicholson Dimes, was able to kind of negotiate the contact with Gateway. They worked very well with us, with reducing our rent so that we could be somewhat affordable. Got the contract with Humanif for the Silver Snickers Senior Program, and went on our way. Immediately Melinda started to combine exercise with broader counseling and formed a non-profit. We noticed that a lot of people in the area had high blood pressure diabetes obesity. So they came in there and that the doctor said that I need to do this. I need to do that and needed a lot of guidance. Out of that came the growth of Dean, diabetes education, exercise, and nutrition. We got some sponsors together, male clinic, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to help get the program going which is a six weeks component of wellness, exercise, education, and nutrition. Melinda found out about the Jacksonville Senior Games and became a competitor herself. But Melinda's new challenge isn't sports related. It's media. There's not very many African-American and particularly women depicted on health magazines. Health and fitness. So I'd like to encourage national publications to look at us a little bit more. Because if you're talking about the weakest and the unhealthy assessment being us, but yet we still we don't see us in print as being healthy, what lessons do we learn? She also has plans to expand Dean's profile in the community. Dean will eventually grow to what is in Pittsburgh and Maryland as the Healthy Black Family Project. All the components to wellness under one roof. Last year Melinda Henry gave up the gym. The Dean's Center is now at Edward Waters College and is part of the college's health disparity program. This is Closing the Loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
