## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Benita Johnson was born in Washington, D.C. In 1979, about four years after the death of my parents, I moved to Pittsburgh to live with my grandmother. And I stayed there until 2011, when I moved down here to Jacksonville for work. As a first person, my family to get a bachelor's degree. Benita worked through college, wherever and whenever she could find work. I worked, doing temporary work, that consulting worked for a lot of nonprofits. I got my bachelor's degree in public administration. I went back to school because when I got a temporary job to work for the 2000s, thought I would parlay that into a consulting position, but because I didn't have a degree, that was not the case. Government work was not her initial goal. I wanted to be in business. I wanted to work for a major corporation. But what happened was Pittsburgh had re-belled it from the steel mills collapsing, but a lot of major businesses left Pittsburgh. I kind of gravitated toward doing community development work as a result of being unemployed and working with the United Way. I started volunteering with them, and as a result of volunteering with them, I wound up being a volunteer coordinator. They were looking for people that had that grassroots connection. The need of Johnson wanted to go to graduate school. I had applied for a couple of graduate programs and didn't get accepted. So I found a job working for the Urban League of Pittsburgh. Doing that time, I got a call from the Regional Census Office saying we're starting our program again for 2010. When the 2010 Census was completed, Benita was even more experienced, but again out of the job. She signed on with a recruiting firm that specialized in federal government jobs. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, her HUD, contacted her about a job in Jacksonville, and the hiring process moved quickly. It was going to be totally different than what I had been doing. I was leaving my friends and people who have become my family. I had never lived in the South before, but there is no shortage of kindness and warmth. The staff here welcomed me with open arms. They have been extremely helpful in helping me learn about the intricacies of what HUD does and how it serves the public. Benita Johnson has no idea about what the future holds. But that's how our entire life has been. She has things she wants to accomplish, and she's looking forward to whatever comes her way. At some point, I would like to go back to school, get my PhD and public policy. I don't know what might have been, but I'm open to any possibility because if I could actually make the leap on faith, to move down here for job, and to be as well received as I've been anything as possible. This is closing the loop. For WJCT News, I'm Warren Miller. Closing the loop is going to be at one spark. Come see us and the river city gourmet shop in the Jacksonville landing.
