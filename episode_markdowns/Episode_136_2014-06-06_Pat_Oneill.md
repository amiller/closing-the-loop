## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Pat O'Neill is a military lifer and a person who is used to high energy activity. I was born in Oklahoma, fan-serve forest based, I was a military brat. I'd been 10 years in the Air Force and I did 27 years in the FAA, as an air traffic controller. Pat started at the Federal Aviation Authority, just as the controllers union had elected a new leader and planned an illegal strike. I had just gotten to Dayton, Ohio, they said, if we go, you better go with us. I waited a long time for this job, I'm going to wait and see what's going on. I got a brand new wife, Brands Bank and New Kid. I don't think this is going to work. 27 years later, Pat was deputy manager of the busy San Diego area, divorced and remarried two annurs, who was then active duty navy. Liz was offered Japan, Guam, or NAS Jacksonville. Although he didn't have to retire, Pat did so in 2007 to accommodate his wife's career. He was unprepared for what happened next. From a person who worked a 60-hour work week to doing nothing in overnight, I wasn't like, oh my gosh, what am I going to do? First off, he wanted to decompress, but I didn't, because I don't know how to decompress. I've never had that much time off in my life. Played golf, I rode bikes, I did stuff, but I was bored to tears. To an logic stand that really hasn't changed that much. Pat and Lizone Neal bought a house in the Jacksonville suburbs, where he rode his bike and played golf. Since I like writing bikes, I can goof around at one of the bike shops in the bike shop. I was wondering if you come and work for us, and I went, what a great idea. And I made $8.50 an hour to sit there and change tires and fix bikes and sell bikes, and it was a great time. But on April 15th, when we had to do taxes, the money that I made in the bicycle shop put us over the top. We just went up another bracket, about 70% of the money that I would have made was taxed. So I walked in the next day and I said, guys, I'm sorry, I can't work anymore. The irony is that Pat knows exactly what he'd like to do. I'd probably be teaching history somewhere, because I love it. So he does the next best thing, tutor at his local high school. They have a mentoring program, and if they have kids that are struggling, they can ask to be associated with something like me that can offer time. None of those activities address his real needs. I'm sitting here watching TV on the History Channel, and I've got, I really should be vacuuming them in a house or doing something like that. That's a stressor. When I'm thinking about 2000 airplanes landing and taking off at L.A., it didn't give in time, that was a stressor. That's just how I am. I just swap one for another. Replacing high impact activity isn't easy when we get older. I was a commando, and I did skydiving and scuba diving and all kinds of fun things that were just adrenaline rush all the time. And that taught me a lot about myself that, yeah, you can't take that other step. Some of those steps were long, deep steps too, when you hop out of the back of an airplane that it was fun. Some people are born to be gardeners. Some people are born to be dog trainers. Some people are born to be doctors, dentists, and some are traffic controllers. And to me, I'd look at the radar scope, and I'd go, okay, I understand. I still have my occasional fits of fantasy, I'd like to go skydive again. And I'm at that point now, where you just realize that, and I just can't do some of those things anymore. This is closing the loop. For WJCT News, I'm Warren Miller.
