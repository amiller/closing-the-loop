## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Ed Lundi greets people with a big laugh. He calls everyone young man or young lady and that's how Ed thinks of himself But 10 years ago, doctors told Ed that his days were numbered. I got drafted in the army right out of high school. I got wounded at the half surgery. I had a total of like 16 surgeries. They had to take them with your type of my testins out. That's what made me retire after that last surgery. I guess I was told that probably best just go ahead and want it because your days is short and I was told that I would never be able to eat solid food. But I guess in my mind I just felt like that I just wasn't going to accept that. I was going to get better. When Ed left the hospital he started walking and he started eating. I won't walk in every morning as like a stronger thought of eating different than I began to walk twice a day and he's time after months of doing this. I was getting stronger feeling good. Capitalism was increasing. I was beginning to eat me that that's the I could never eat again. No solid food. I was eating stakes. Life's hotels and somewhere everything and I saw wow this was good. About four years ago, Ed got a flyer in the mail about the Jacksonville senior games. Competition segmented by age groups for people 50 and up. Ed was retired and working out. He didn't think too much about competing but the senior games did sound like fun. Got the flyer from the senior games and I said wow I'm like try that. I wasn't trained at anything like that so the Howgeum readers I got second and then I found out that the guy the guy first he held the state for probably the last three or four years. I think I could blend this event and then I did the lifting the same year and I got you know I won first and the bench and the dead live. I started feeling good about things you know and I just started training a little harder so last I guess four years I won the dead live in state and the last were two or three years I won the hundred meters in state so I hold the record now for both events. I know I can get stronger and I can get faster. Events in the senior games especially weightlifting are collegial. All the contestants cheer each other to help with setting weights on the bars and no one cheers more than Ed. His involvement in sports goes beyond just cheering though. All I want to do now is give back. I tutor I got three young boys that I tutor at middle school. They're weightlifting training, track and feel like coach and I try to inspire other people like my age. You get involved in fitness. I'm not. Oh you know but to them you know they like 20 something. I think I'm a old man. As you see now you got something look forward to when you get my age. You still can do these things if you want to. Ed mentors students and athletes for the joy of it but he also knows that when you help someone you never really know how far your gift may travel. I look at it now it's not about me anymore I got a second chance. Sometimes you do things in life you never know who watching you you never know who you're going to inspire by doing what you're doing. You might not even know someone can be sitting out watching you do something in this. Wow. Man I think I can do this too. This is closing the loop for WJC T News. I'm Warren Miller.
