## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
When Adam knew as a kid, he had the same ideas of what he would do when he grew up with other kids. The typical thing is like, Castrenaud, Pilot, stuff like that, and the little kids want to do nothing really. That realistic, I wanted to be a pilot for a long time. The Marine Corps thing probably happened when I was like 16. Adam's father was a Marine, and Adam had known about the Corps for most of his life. My dad did talk a lot about it, but I didn't really understand it that much. I thought that pilots were cooler. I did bear force, ROTC, and that was a lot of fun, but in high school I just wanted to be a Marine. The Marines had a different way of doing things. It was different than the Army recruiter than the Navy recruiter. They wanted more Adam, I think. So Adam, due in listed in the Marine Corps, was on a waiting list until graduation. I graduated on the first to went to boot camp on the sixth. boot camp was pretty much in line when I thought I could be because I had a whole year to research it. I looked a lot into it. I just kept getting more excited about it that whole year. It's a pretty constant stress level the entire time you're there. It was not used to that in high school, especially my senior year. And then you go from that to 100% seven days a week for three months. And for a kid who would live this entire life at home with his parents, there were some differences. Things like having AC while you're sleeping. The hardest part was when I actually got to my unit. Because in boot camp you're babyed basically the entire time. They're telling you what to do where to go, how to act. But when you get to your actual unit you get out of your schools. You actually have to know your job and you have to be very professional. In my particular job in the Marines, I'm talking to higher level people. I'm a communications Marine. So I deal with keeping communications up. Adam now is a full-time student in computer science at UNF. As well as a part-time employee, one of the large supermarket chains. I like programming. I took a visual basic class in the summer. I really like it. Just now getting into job. It's interesting. Yeah. Different way of thinking. His military service gives him a perspective on college. That's a little different from most other students's age. It gives me a more respect for attitude towards college. Because I know that I might not have been able to do it. I did spend a year on active duty. So there was a lot of anticipation of going to college. Getting out of there. I just appreciate it a lot more. I think the average student does. Adam is engaged to be married. Although his fiance and he will wait until he graduates from college in two years. Where the live after that is undecided. Our plans are an hour to leave, eventually. Because my job is a lot more opportunities in other places. But a lot of Adam do plans are tentative. Because he's one phone call away from active duty. For being a college student who's also in the Marine Corps. There's always that thing in the back of your head that says I could go somewhere. Is something where to pop off in a different country. That could happen anytime, basically. Yeah. I try not to look at it. What they tell us is have your gear ready. Have it waterproof. Because we could be getting on an airplane or a boat next week. And if you get a call, it could be 24 hours. It could be a week. It's 24 hours. It's going to have contact with everybody. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. A more and more.
