## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Jim Woody grew up in Baltimore, joined the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1977, and moved to Jacksonville in 1988. I am a safety and health professional. It's thought I was going to be a music teacher actually. The Army Corps of Engineers deals with lots of construction management. Jacksonville's a civil-worked district, so it's mainly dreading, flight control, stuff, beach, nourishment. Jim's basic job was reviewing contractor safety plans, and his responsibilities changed when he got to Jacksonville. It changed drastically when I changed the type of position I had in the Army Corps of Engineers. 89 was Hurricane Hugo, which affected the Virgin Islands quite a bit. That was my first experience with emergency operations. After that, the big one was Hurricane Andrew. A lot of experience gained there, and also realized there was a large need for an organized approach for safety and health for those who were involved. Those large national emergencies, which we did not have at that time. After 9-11, Jim became a manager of safety and health for emergency response, which meant he would hit the road. I would travel a week, every five weeks. I would deploy other safety and health professionals from the Corps, and then after things were going pretty well, I would go down range to the event. But when he wasn't on the road, Jim Woody hung out at the beach. I had lived in Atlantic Beach since 87 when I came down. I always thought if you were going to live in Florida, you should live very, very close to the water, or while living Florida. Almost two years ago, Jim officially retired from the Army Corps of Engineers. He has some things he wants to do, especially involving music. Jim has played drums for most of his life. Now that I'm retired, I want to learn how to play keyboard, much much better than I know how to play it now. But he hasn't fully retired. He has in fact what many might consider the ideal retirement situation. 31 December 2011, I officially retired from the federal government, and I received my annuity each month. The Army Corps of Engineers has a program that's called re-hired annuidence. When an Ipt-acorn needs you and your expertise, they can call you and ask you to go to work for it could be a week. It could be a month or several months or whatever. And then when they no longer need you to do that special project that they have no one to do, then you go back into what you would call retirement again. You go back on a golf course or whatever it is that you do. But when you come on board actively, you're a full-fledged government employee again. And you still receive your annuity, plus you receive whatever pay you would get while you're actively working. So yes, I'm on the roles of the re-hired annuidence even though I am officially retired. After decades of working on emergencies and writing the safety rules for his former employer, Jim Woody has learned some things about himself as well. I like to plan. I like that division. I like to plan. And I like to kind of map out a road ahead to get to what I like to do. If I don't have a road map than I am a little frustrated, but if I have a plan and I have to divert from it, that doesn't frustrate me. I'm an organized type of person. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
