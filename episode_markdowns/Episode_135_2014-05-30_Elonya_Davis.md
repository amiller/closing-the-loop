## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
Elagna Davis is a natural salesperson. The jobs she got invariably started as customer service and moved into sales. This is like a natural aptitude. My whole family are a line of entrepreneurs. So as a child, I actually ran a couple of small businesses on my own. So I'm used to leading in sales and management and all of that in one. Elagna usually has had side jobs selling and promoting. She was asked if she'd be interested in promoting the Adrian Pickett, a young artist who did portraits in charcoal using cue tips instead of brushes or pencils. Someone introduced us and said, I know this fantastic artist and maybe you can help him out with his sales. We met, couldn't believe what I was saying. Like, yeah, sure you did this, dude. But once I got to know him and saw that it was real, he actually had this incredible talent. I couldn't turn it down. The fact that she knew nothing about the art world and the business of art didn't face her. I had no idea of what I was doing. Had to learn the business very thankful for the people that have educated me because I did not go to school to learn this business at all. Adrian, being the consummate artist, has taught me so much about it. But the opportunity to learn is what excited Elagna Davis most of all. Very challenging and I think I enjoyed that more than anything. The other challenge was building a working relationship with her new client. He didn't like me at first. He didn't like my style. I was too direct for him. I changed his whole format when I met him. After a while, he earned my respect. And I earned his from that point on. It's pretty much been gravy. The relationship became a romantic one as well. Elagna Davis and Adrian pick it or married now. They have a gallery downtown and market Adrian's art through more modern channels as well. Building the social media, the outdoor events and building a follow-wing, we've definitely created our own network. More than anything else that's what sustains us, the relationships that we've built. And if Elagna Davis's plans come to pass, Jacksonville is just the beginning. I want to build a brand beyond what you see. That art business you see the art. I would like our brand to be sort of synonymous to a Michael Jordan brand. I have in the few years that we've been doing this actually helped out a lot more artists in direction as to what they should do. And I would like to do that more, especially where I can with the kids. I would like to open a school. My creation out of this whole thing has been the junior jacks art expo. And that's something that I find passionate about because it's tailoring children for a brighter future. A natural talent often is suppressed. And as is usually true of accomplished salespeople, Elagna Davis lives her goals on a daily basis. Being a wonderful international brand where we are educating people on the significance of art and allowing people to express themselves. I would like to get people still excited about their natural talents. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
