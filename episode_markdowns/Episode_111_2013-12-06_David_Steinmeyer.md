## Interview Transcript

# Transcribed Audio
David Steinmeier grew up in Jacksonville. A few blocks away from where his wife Debbie grew up. Murray Hill on a west side. We knew each other in Grey's school. She kind of didn't like me then. Thought I was a trouble maker. After high school, David enlisted in the National Guard. That's when Debbie's in his romance started. After I got back from basic training, we met that one love of like three months later, we've been married and that was 32 years ago. But David Steinmeier knew that the National Guard was not a full-time occupation. And he now had the motivation to find one. When I met her, I decided why I need something that would be a career. I had an uncle where he had electrical business. I went to him and said, I'm getting married next week. I need a good job and he hired me. I've been doing it ever since. David has worked for an electrical company for about 20 years. Almost all of it on-site is a contractor at one of Jacksonville's major manufacturers. Along the way, David and Debbie Steinmeier became parents, then grandparents and bought a piece of land and stark. But David thought his retirement would be much better if he signed on for another stint in the National Guard. I'd got in the National Guard right out of the high school, did 10 years then and got out. Then in 2006 decided after seeing how my parents and other people struggle with health care that I needed to get that other 10 years to get that retirement. So this health care for a rest of my life. So I went back in in 2006. The wars in Asia were in full steam and David knew that deployment was a possibility. He didn't realize how soon though. My promise, Debbie, this is signaling you didn't want to ever deploy. In 2008, we got the word that we would deploy. I mean, I went back in pretty much the same rank I got out of. Had to go to school for a new MOS. From pre-deployment to post-deployment, the mission lasted a year. How's in our cut? It's on our rainy and border. In country, 10 months in the combat zone. And when his deployment was over, David Steinmeier returned to his family and to his job in Jacksonville. Just paid right back up where I left off. Federal law, they had to save his job. David is still in the National Guard and there are still American troops in Afghanistan. David could be deployed a second time. Our five-year cycle just got up. So we're eligible to be deployed again. So that could come. They started giving briefings last month. You start re-metewing the lines and it looks like, no, we go, we go. But redeployment also would have a good side to it. Another deployment would give me two more years off. I could retire earlier. Every six months in combat zone, one year earlier, you can get your retirement. So I had 10 months in, so six months of that took one year off. Another deployment, six months would give me two more, six months period as it takes two more years off. When David retires from the guard, who retire from his electrician job as well. Getting asked all the time if I do side work, and that is don't have the time now. And time is something that David Steinmeier is looking forward to having more of. He's become more patient after his deployment in Iraq. I experienced things that another wise never would have. I don't take a lot of things for granted. I appreciate what I have a lot more after seeing what other people have to go through and where they don't have. We don't realize in this country just how great we have it. To you see just how bad some other people have it. This is closing the loop for WJCT News. I'm Warren Miller.
