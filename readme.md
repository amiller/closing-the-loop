## About the Show

**Closing the Loop** was Warren Miller's weekly radio series on WJCT that explored "how North Florida residents cope with drastic life changes and how they adapt to their new realities." Over nearly three years, Warren conducted roughly 200 interviews, creating a unique archive of human resilience stories.

The show began during the economic recovery period and evolved into something much broader - a weekly exploration of how people overcome challenges, from economic hardship to major life transitions. Episodes aired every Friday morning on WJCT, with Warren's respectful interviewing style earning him recognition for telling "people's stories with respect."
